# Created in Java for RevUp Final Project

After struggling through two other ideas, I chose to use a repo that had been nothing more than a README file for approximately six years. The **Nexus of All Realities** is a game and player management system for tabletop role-playing games. This version is just a character creation app based on the D&D character sheet (and hopefully some cool stuff from the basic set manual) that rolls the dice to create character states and behaviors.

## Inspiration

Are you old like me and tried to teach your children Dungeons & Dragons? Felt even more stupid than when you try to help with their homework, right?

This app does all those newfangled calculations -- that make the game both more realistic but also more of a pain in the buttocks -- for you.

I'll sidestep the bummer that you don't get to roll the dice by saying, even if you didn't buy or lost your dice, the app takes care of that, too.

## Features

Methods for "rolling" three six-sided dice (the sum of three random numbers) to complete character creation
    - Strength
    - Dexterity
    - Constitution
    - Intelligence
    - Wisdom
    - Charisma

## Requirements

### 4 Pillars of OOP

- Inheritance
- Polymorphism (overloading or overriding)
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction (Abstract class or Interface)

### Other

- 3+ Classes
- 3+ Constructors
- 4+ methods
- Scanner to get responses from the user
- A switch statement
- 1+ exception handler(s)
- A Collections structures (ArrayList, HashSet, Queue, Stack, LinkedList, HashMap)
- A loop that modifies, organizes or returns values from the iteration

## Original README for Nexus of All Realities

Game and player management system for role-playing games.

"a D&D character sheet (and another D&D tool) that rolls the dice to create character ... what are they? attributes? properties? ;-) So that one just  and then some other methods that "roll" the other dice with 4, 8, 20 ... and there's a 10-sided, too? right? It's been a while."

    - Constitution
    - Intelligence
    - Wisdom
    - Charisma

### Characters In Play

Anywhere from assistance in character use ("Saving Throws", "skills", "proficiencies", etc.) to ...

### Track Games

A game "secretary" that tracks rolls, decisions, outcomes to "teach" *Create Alternate Timelines*

### Fully Automatic Game

Just to watch from creation, through automated play and conclusion.
Use(s) all kinds of crazy cool algorithms.

### Create Alternate Timelines

- Choose a point/decision/roll in fully automated game to watch different outcome(s).
- Use Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence.

### Augmented-Reality for use with a table/board

### Map Creation
