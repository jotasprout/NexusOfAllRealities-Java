# Created in Java for RevUp Final Project

After struggling through two other ideas, I chose to use a repo that had been nothing more than a README file for approximately six years. The **Nexus of All Realities** is a game and player management system for tabletop role-playing games. This version is just a character creation app based on the D&D character sheet (and hopefully some cool stuff from the basic set manual) that rolls the dice to create character states and behaviors.

## Features

### Character Creation

Methods for "rolling" three six-sided dice (the sum of three random numbers) to complete character creation
    - Strength
    - Dexterity
    - Constitution
    - Intelligence
    - Wisdom
    - Charisma

## Requirements

### 4 Pillars of OOP

- Inheritance
- Polymorphism (overloading or overriding)
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction (Abstract class or Interface)

### Other

+ 3+ Classes
- 3+ Constructors
- 4+ methods
+ Scanner to get responses from the user 
+ A switch statement
- 1+ exception handler(s)
+ A Collections structures (ArrayList, HashSet, Queue, Stack, LinkedList, HashMap)
+ A loop that modifies, organizes or returns values from the iteration

## Original README for Nexus of All Realities

Game and player management system for role-playing games.

"a D&D character sheet (and another D&D tool) that rolls the dice to create character ... what are they? attributes? properties? ;-) So that one just  and then some other methods that "roll" the other dice with 4, 8, 20 ... and there's a 10-sided, too? right? It's been a while."

### RPG Character Creation

    - Strength
    - Dexterity
    - Constitution
    - Intelligence
    - Wisdom
    - Charisma

### Characters In Play

Anywhere from assistance in character use ("Saving Throws", "skills", "proficiencies", etc.) to ...

### Track Games

A game "secretary" that tracks rolls, decisions, outcomes to "teach" *Create Alternate Timelines*

### Fully Automatic Game

Just to watch from creation, through automated play and conclusion.
Use(s) all kinds of crazy cool algorithms.

### Create Alternate Timelines

- Choose a point/decision/roll in fully automated game to watch different outcome(s).
- Use Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence.

### Augmented-Reality for use with a table/board

### Map Creation
