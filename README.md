# RevUp Final Project

After struggling through two other ideas, I chose to use a repo that had been nothing more than a README file for approximately six years. The **Nexus of All Realities** is a game and player management system for tabletop role-playing games. This version is just a character creation app based on the D&D character sheet (and hopefully some cool stuff from the basic set manual) that rolls the dice to create character states and behaviors. 

## Features
