INTRODUCTION 


THE DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS ROLEPLAYING GAME IS ABOUT 
storytelling in worlds of swords and sorcery. It shares ele- 
ments with childhood games of make-believe. Like those 
games, D&amp;D is driven by imagination. It’s about picturing 
the towering castle beneath the stormy night sky and 
imagining how a fantasy adventurer might react to the 
challenges that scene presents. 


Dungeon Master (DM): After passing through the 
craggy peaks, the road takes a sudden turn to the east 
and Castle Ravenloft towers before you. Crumbling 
towers of stone keep a silent watch over the approach. 
They look like abandoned guardhouses. Beyond these, a 
wide chasm gapes, disappearing into the deep fog below. 
A lowered drawbridge spans the chasm, leading to an 
arched entrance to the castle courtyard. The chains of 
the drawbridge creak in the wind, their rust-eaten iron 
straining with the weight. From atop the high strong walls, 
stone gargoyles stare at you from hollow sockets and grin 
hideously. A rotting wooden portcullis, green with growth, 
hangs in the entry tunnel. Beyond this, the main doors of 
Castle Ravenloft stand open, a rich warm light spilling into 
the courtyard. 

Phillip (playing Gareth): | want to look at the gargoyles. | 
have a feeling they’re not just statues. 

Amy (playing Riva): The drawbridge looks precarious? | 
want to see how sturdy it is. Do | think we can cross it, or 
is it going to collapse under our weight? 


Unlike a game of make-believe, D&amp;D gives structure to 
the stories, a way of determining the consequences of the 
adventurers’ action. Players roll dice to resolve whether 
their attacks hit or miss or whether their adventurers 
can scale a cliff, roll away from the strike of a magical 
lightning bolt, or pull off some other dangerous task. Any- 
thing is possible, but the dice make some outcomes more 
probable than others. 


Dungeon Master (DM): OK, one at a time. Phillip, you’re 
looking at the gargoyles? 

Phillip: Yeah. Is there any hint they might be creatures 
and not decorations? 

DM: Make an Intelligence check. 

Phillip: Does my Investigation skill apply? 

DM: Sure! 

Phillip (rolling a d20): Ugh. Seven. 

DM: They look like decorations to you. And Amy, Riva is 
checking out the drawbridge? 


In the DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS game, each player cre- 
ates an adventurer (also called a character) and teams 
up with other adventurers (played by friends). Working 


D&amp;D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission grantec 


together, the group might explore a dark dungeon, a ru- 
ined city, a haunted castle, a lost temple deep in a jungle, 
or a lava-filled cavern beneath a mysterious mountain. 
The adventurers can solve puzzles, talk with other char- 
acters, battle fantastic monsters, and discover fabulous 
magic items and other treasure. 

One player, however, takes on the role of the Dungeon 
Master (DM), the game’s lead storyteller and referee. The 
DM creates adventures for the characters, who navigate 
its hazards and decide which paths to explore. The DM 
might describe the entrance to Castle Ravenloft, and the 
players decide what they want their adventurers to do. 
Will they walk across the dangerously weathered draw- 
bridge? Tie themselves together with rope to minimize 
the chance that someone will fall if the drawbridge gives 
way? Or cast a spell to carry them over the chasm? 

Then the DM determines the results of the adventurers’ 
actions and narrates what they experience. Because the 
DM can improvise to react to anything the players at- 
tempt, D&amp;D is infinitely flexible, and each adventure can 
be exciting and unexpected. 

The game has no real end; when one story or quest 
wraps up, another one can begin, creating an ongoing 
story called a campaign. Many people who play the 
game keep their campaigns going for months or years, 
meeting with their friends every week or so to pick up 
the story where they left off. The adventurers grow in 
might as the campaign continues. Each monster de- 
feated, each adventure completed, and each treasure 
recovered not only adds to the continuing story, but also 
earns the adventurers new capabilities. This increase 
in power is reflected by an adventurer’s level. 

There’s no winning and losing in the DUNGEONS &amp; 
DRAGONS game—at least, not the way those terms are 
usually understood. Together, the DM and the players 
create an exciting story of bold adventurers who confront 
deadly perils. Sometimes an adventurer might come to 
a grisly end, torn apart by ferocious monsters or done in 
by a nefarious villain. Even so, the other adventurers can 
search for powerful magic to revive their fallen comrade, 
or the player might choose to create a new character to 
carry on. The group might fail to complete an adventure 
successfully, but if everyone had a good time and created a 
memorable story, they all win. 


WORLDS OF ADVENTURE 


The many worlds of the DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS game 
are places of magic and monsters, of brave warriors and 
spectacular adventures. They begin with a foundation of 
medieval fantasy and then add the creatures, places, and 
magic that make these worlds unique. 

The worlds of the DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS game exist 
within a vast cosmos called the multiverse, connected 
in strange and mysterious ways to one another and to 
other planes of existence, such as the Elemental Plane 
of Fire and the Infinite Depths of the Abyss. Within this 
multiverse are an endless variety of worlds. Many of 
them have been published as official settings for the D&amp;D 
game. The legends of the Forgotten Realms, Dragonlance, 


INTRODUCTION

Greyhawk, Dark Sun, Mystara, and Eberron settings are 
woven together in the fabric of the multiverse. Alongside 
these worlds are hundreds of thousands more, created 

by generations of D&amp;D players for their own games. And 
amid all the richness of the multiverse, you might create a 
world of your own. 

All these worlds share characteristics, but each world 
is set apart by its own history and cultures, distinctive 
monsters and races, fantastic geography, ancient dun- 
geons, and scheming villains. Some races have unusual 
traits in different worlds. The halflings of the Dark Sun 
setting, for example, are jungle-dwelling cannibals, and 
the elves are desert nomads. Some worlds feature races 
unknown in other settings, such as Eberron’s warforged, 
soldiers created and imbued with life to fight in the Last 
War. Some worlds are dominated by one great story, like 
the War of the Lance that plays a central role in the Drag- 
onlance setting. But they’re all D&amp;D worlds, and you can 
use the rules in this book to create a character and play 
in any one of them. 

Your DM might set the campaign on one of these 
worlds or on one that he or she created. Because there is 
so much diversity among the worlds of D&amp;D, you should 
check with your DM about any house rules that will affect 
your play of the game. Ultimately, the Dungeon Master is 
the authority on the campaign and its setting, even if the 
setting is a published world. 


USING THESE RULES 


The D&amp;D Basic Rules document has four main parts. 

Part 1 is about creating a character, providing the rules 
and guidance you need to make the character you'll play 
in the game. It includes information on the various races, 
classes, backgrounds, equipment, and other customiza- 
tion options that you can choose from. Many of the rules 
in part 1 rely on material in parts 2 and 3. 

Part 2 details the rules of how to play the game, beyond 
the basics described in this introduction. That part cov- 
ers the kinds of die rolls you make to determine success 
or failure at the tasks your character attempts, and de- 
scribes the three broad categories of activity in the game: 
exploration, interaction, and combat. 

Part 3 is all about magic. It covers the nature of magic 
in the worlds of D&amp;D, the rules for spellcasting, and a 
selection of typical spells available to magic-using charac- 
ters (and monsters) in the game. 

Part 4 is especially for the Dungeon Master. It contains 
instructions for how to challenge the player characters 
with adversaries that are a good test of their abilities, 
plus dozens of ready-to-use monster descriptions. 

It also provides a sampling of magic items that the 
characters can earn as their rewards for vanquishing 
those monsters. 

The end of the document contains supplemental mate- 
rial. Appendix A collects all the definitions of conditions 
that can affect characters and monsters. Appendix B is a 
brief discussion of deities in the game, particularly those 
in the Forgotten Realms setting. Appendix C describes 
the five factions in the Forgotten Realms that characters 
can become associated with. Finally, a three-page char- 
acter sheet provides a standardized way for players to 
record and keep track of their characters’ abilities and 
possessions. 


How TO PLAY 


The play of the DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS game unfolds ac- 
cording to this basic pattern. 

1. The DM describes the environment. The DM 
tells the players where their adventurers are and what’s 
around them, presenting the basic scope of options that 
present themselves (how many doors lead out of a room, 
what’s on a table, who’s in the tavern, and so on). 

2. The players describe what they want to do. Some- 
times one player speaks for the whole party, saying, 
“We'll take the east door,” for example. Other times, 
different adventurers do different things: one adventurer 
might search a treasure chest while a second examines 
an esoteric symbol engraved on a wall and a third keeps 
watch for monsters. The players don’t need to take turns, 
but the DM listens to every player and decides how to re- 
solve those actions. 

Sometimes, resolving a task is easy. If an adventurer 
wants to walk across a room and open a door, the DM 
might just say that the door opens and describe what lies 
beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might 
hide a deadly trap, or some other circumstance might 
make it challenging for an adventurer to complete a task. 
In those cases, the DM decides what happens, often 
relying on the roll of a die to determine the results of 
an action. 

3. The DM narrates the results of the adventurers’ 
actions. Describing the results often leads to another de- 
cision point, which brings the flow of the game right back 
to step 1. 

This pattern holds whether the adventurers are cau- 
tiously exploring a ruin, talking to a devious prince, or 
locked in mortal combat against a mighty dragon. In 
certain situations, particularly combat, the action is more 
structured and the players (and DM) do take turns choos- 
ing and resolving actions. But most of the time, play is 
fluid and flexible, adapting to the circumstances of the 
adventure. 

Often the action of an adventure takes place in the 
imagination of the players and DM, relying on the DM’s 
verbal descriptions to set the scene. Some DMs like to 
use music, art, or recorded sound effects to help set the 
mood, and many players and DMs alike adopt different 
voices for the various adventurers, monsters, and other 
characters they play in the game. Sometimes, a DM 
might lay out a map and use tokens or miniature figures 
to represent each creature involved in a scene to help the 
players keep track of where everyone is. 


GAME DICE 


The game uses polyhedral dice with different numbers of 
sides. You can find dice like these in game stores and in 
many bookstores. 

In these rules, the different dice are referred to by the 
letter d followed by the number of sides: d4, d6, d8, d10, 
d12, and d20. For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die (the 
typical cube that many games use). 

Percentile dice, or d100, work a little differently. You 
generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two 
different ten-sided dice numbered from 0 to 9. One die 
(designated before you roll) gives the tens digit, and 
the other gives the ones digit. If you roll a 7 and a 1, for 


INTRODUCTION 











example, the number rolled is 71. Two Os represent 100. 
Some ten-sided dice are numbered in tens (00, 10, 20, 
and so on), making it easier to distinguish the tens digit 
from the ones digit. In this case, a roll of 70 and 1 is 71, 
and 00 and 0 is 100. 

When you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how many 
dice to roll of a certain type, as well as what modifiers to 
add. For example, “3d8 + 5” means you roll three eight- 
sided dice, add them together, and add 5 to the total. 

The same d notation appears in the expressions “1d3” 
and “1d2.” To simulate the roll of 1d3, roll a d6 and divide 
the number rolled by 2 (round up). To simulate the roll of 
1d2, roll any die and assign a 1 or 2 to the roll depending 
on whether it was odd or even. (Alternatively, if the num- 
ber rolled is more than half the number of sides on the 
die, it’s a 2.) 


THE D20 


Does an adventurer’s sword swing hurt a dragon or just 


bounce off its iron-hard scales? Will the ogre believe an 
outrageous bluff? Can a character swim across a raging 
river? Can a character avoid the main blast of a fireball, 
or does he or she take full damage from the blaze? In 
cases where the outcome of an action is uncertain, the 
DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS game relies on rolls of a 20-sided 
die, a d20, to determine success or failure. 

Every character and monster in the game has capa- 
bilities defined by six ability scores. The abilities are 
Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, 
and Charisma, and they typically range from 3 to 18 for 
most adventurers. (Monsters might have scores as low as 
1 or as high as 30.) These ability scores, and the ability 
modifiers derived from them, are the basis for almost 
every d20 roll that a player makes on a character’s or 
monster’s behalf. 

Ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are the 
three main kinds of d20 rolls, forming the core of the 
rules of the game. All three follow these simple steps. 

1. Roll the die and add a modifier. Roll a d20 and add 
the relevant modifier. This is typically the modifier de- 
rived from one of the six ability scores, and it sometimes 
includes a proficiency bonus to reflect a character’s par- 
ticular skill. (Gee chapter 1 for details on each ability and 
how to determine an ability’s modifier.) 

2. Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties. A 
class feature, a spell, a particular circumstance, or some 
other effect might give a bonus or penalty to the check. 

3. Compare the total to a target number. If the total 
equals or exceeds the target number, the ability check, 
attack roll, or saving throw is a success. Otherwise, it’s a 
failure. The DM is usually the one who determines target 
numbers and tells players whether their ability checks, 
attack rolls, and saving throws succeed or fail. 

The target number for an ability check or a saving 
throw is called a Difficulty Class (DC). The target num- 
ber for an attack roll is called an Armor Class (AC). 

This simple rule governs the resolution of most tasks 
in D&amp;D play. Chapter 7 provides more detailed rules for 
using the d20 in the game. 


ADVANTAGE AND DISADVANTAGE 


Sometimes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw 
is modified by special situations called advantage and dis- 
advantage. Advantage reflects the positive circumstances 
surrounding a d20 roll, while disadvantage reflects the 
opposite. When you have either advantage or disadvan- 
tage, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use 
the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use 
the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if 
you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a5, you use the 
5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, 
you use the 17. 

More detailed rules for advantage and disadvantage are 
presented in chapter 7. 


SPECIFIC BEATS GENERAL 


This book contains rules, especially in parts 2 and 3, that 
govern how the game plays. That said, many racial traits, 
class features, spells, magic items, monster abilities, and 
other game elements break the general rules in some 
way, creating an exception to how the rest of the game 
works. Remember this: If a specific rule contradicts a 
general rule, the specific rule wins. 

Exceptions to the rules are often minor. For instance, 
many adventurers don’t have proficiency with longbows, 
but every wood elf does because of a racial trait. That 
trait creates a minor exception in the game. Other exam- 
ples of rule-breaking are more conspicuous. For instance, 
an adventurer can’t normally pass through walls, but 
some spells make that possible. Magic accounts for most 
of the major exceptions to the rules. 


ROUND DOWN 


There’s one more general rule you need to know at the 
outset. Whenever you divide a number in the game, round 
down if you end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is 
one-half or greater. 


ADVENTURES 


The DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS game consists of a group of 
characters embarking on an adventure that the Dungeon 
Master presents to them. Each character brings partic- 
ular capabilities to the adventure in the form of ability 
scores and skills, class features, racial traits, equipment, 
and magic items. Every character is different, with var- 
ious strengths and weaknesses, so the best party of 
adventurers is one in which the characters complement 
each other and cover the weaknesses of their compan- 
ions. The adventurers must cooperate to successfully 
complete the adventure. 

The adventure is the heart of the game, a story with 
a beginning, a middle, and an end. An adventure might 
be created by the Dungeon Master or purchased off the 
shelf, tweaked and modified to suit the DM’s needs and 
desires. In either case, an adventure features a fantastic 
setting, whether it’s an underground dungeon, a crum- 
bling castle, a stretch of wilderness, or a bustling city. It 
features a rich cast of characters: the adventurers created 
and played by the other players at the table, as well as 
nonplayer characters (NPCs). Those characters might 
be patrons, allies, enemies, hirelings, or just background

extras in an adventure. Often, one of the NPCs is a villain 
whose agenda drives much of an adventure’s action. 

Over the course of their adventures, the characters are 
confronted by a variety of creatures, objects, and situa- 
tions that they must deal with in some way. Sometimes 
the adventurers and other creatures do their best to 
kill or capture each other in combat. At other times, the 
adventurers talk to another creature (or even a magical 
object) with a goal in mind. And often, the adventurers 
spend time trying to solve a puzzle, bypass an obstacle, 
find something hidden, or unravel the current situation. 
Meanwhile, the adventurers explore the world, making 
decisions about which way to travel and what they’ll try 
to do next. 

Adventures vary in length and complexity. A short ad- 
venture might present only a few challenges, and it might 
take no more than a single game session to complete. A 
long adventure can involve hundreds of combats, interac- 
tions, and other challenges, and take dozens of sessions 
to play through, stretching over weeks or months of real 
time. Usually, the end of an adventure is marked by the 
adventurers heading back to civilization to rest and enjoy 
the spoils of their labors. 

But that’s not the end of the story. You can think of 
an adventure as a single episode of a TV series, made 
up of multiple exciting scenes. A campaign is the whole 
series—a string of adventures joined together, with a con- 
sistent group of adventurers following the narrative from 
start to finish. 


THE THREE PILLARS OF ADVENTURE 


Adventurers can try to do anything their players can 
imagine, but it can be helpful to talk about their activities 
in three broad categories: exploration, social interaction, 
and combat. 

Exploration includes both the adventurers’ movement 
through the world and their interaction with objects and 
situations that require their attention. Exploration is the 
give-and-take of the players describing what they want 
their characters to do, and the Dungeon Master telling 
the players what happens as a result. On a large scale, 
that might involve the characters spending a day crossing 
a rolling plain or an hour making their way through cav- 
erns underground. On the smallest scale, it could mean 
one character pulling a lever in a dungeon room to see 
what happens. 

Social interaction features the adventurers talking to 
someone (or something) else. It might mean demanding 
that a captured scout reveal the secret entrance to the 
goblin lair, getting information from a rescued prisoner, 
pleading for mercy from an orc chieftain, or persuading 
a talkative magic mirror to show a distant location to the 
adventurers. 

The rules in chapters 7 and 8 support exploration and 
social interaction, as do many class features in chapter 3 
and personality traits in chapter 4. 

Combat, the focus of chapter 9, involves characters 
and other creatures swinging weapons, casting spells, 
maneuvering for position, and so on—all in an effort 





to defeat their opponents, whether that means killing 
every enemy, taking captives, or forcing a rout. Combat 
is the most structured element of a D&amp;D session, with 
creatures taking turns to make sure that everyone gets 

a chance to act. Even in the context of a pitched battle, 
there’s still plenty of opportunity for adventurers to at- 
tempt wacky stunts like surfing down a flight of stairs on 
a shield, to examine the environment (perhaps by pulling 
a mysterious lever), and to interact with other creatures, 
including allies, enemies, and neutral parties. 


THE WONDERS OF MAGIC 


Few D&amp;D adventures end without something magical 
happening. Whether helpful or harmful, magic appears 
frequently in the life of an adventurer, and it is the focus 
of chapters 10 and 11. 

In the worlds of DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS, practitioners 
of magic are rare, set apart from the masses of people 
by their extraordinary talent. Common folk might see 
evidence of magic on a regular basis, but it’s usually 
minor—a fantastic monster, a visibly answered prayer, 

a wizard walking through the streets with an animated 
shield guardian as a bodyguard. 

For adventurers, though, magic is key to their survival. 
Without the healing magic of clerics and paladins, adven- 
turers would quickly succumb to their wounds. Without 
the uplifting magical support of bards and clerics, war- 
riors might be overwhelmed by powerful foes. Without 
the sheer magical power and versatility of wizards and 
druids, every threat would be magnified tenfold. 

Magic is also a favored tool of villains. Many adven- 
tures are driven by the machinations of spellcasters who 
are hellbent on using magic for some ill end. A cult leader 
seeks to awaken a god who slumbers beneath the sea, a 
hag kidnaps youths to magically drain them of their vigor, 
a mad wizard labors to invest an army of automatons 
with a facsimile of life, a dragon begins a mystical ritual 
to rise up as a god of destruction—these are just a few 
of the magical threats that adventurers might face. With 
magic of their own, in the form of spells and magic items, 
the adventurers might prevail!

CHAPTER |: STEP-BY-STEP CHARACTERS 


YOUR FIRST STEP IN PLAYING AN ADVENTURER IN THE 
DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS game is to imagine and create a 
character of your own. Your character is a combination 
of game statistics, roleplaying hooks, and your imagina- 
tion. You choose a race (Such as human or halfling) and 
a class (such as fighter or wizard). You also invent the 
personality, appearance, and backstory of your character. 
Once completed, your character serves as your repre- 
sentative in the game, your avatar in the DUNGEONS &amp; 
DRAGONS world. 

Before you dive into step 1 below, think about the 
kind of adventurer you want to play. You might be a cou- 
rageous fighter, a skulking rogue, a fervent cleric, or a 
flamboyant wizard. Or you might be more interested in 
an unconventional character, such as a brawny rogue 
who likes hand-to-hand combat, or a sharpshooter who 
picks off enemies from afar. Do you like fantasy fiction 
featuring dwarves or elves? Try building a character of 
one of those races. Do you want your character to be the 
toughest adventurer at the table? Consider the fighter 
class. If you don’t know where else to begin, take a look 
at the illustrations in this book to see what catches 
your interest. 

Once you have a character in mind, follow these steps 
in order, making decisions that reflect the character you 
want. Your conception of your character might evolve 
with each choice you make. What’s important is that you 
come to the table with a character you're excited to play. 

Throughout this chapter, we use the term character 
sheet to mean whatever you use to track your character, 
whether it’s a formal character sheet (like the one at the 
end of these rules), some form of digital record, or a piece 
of notebook paper. An official D&amp;D character sheet is a 
fine place to start until you know what information you 
need and how you use it during the game. 


BUILDING BRUENOR 

Each step of character creation includes an example of 
that step, with a player named Bob building his dwarf 
character, Bruenor. 


1. CHOOSE A RACE 


Every character belongs to a race, one of the many in- 
telligent humanoid species in the D&amp;D world. The most 
common player character races are dwarves, elves, 
halflings, and humans. Some races also have subraces, 
such as mountain dwarf or wood elf. Chapter 2 provides 
more information about these races. 

The race you choose contributes to your character’s 
identity in an important way, by establishing a general 
appearance and the natural talents gained from culture 
and ancestry. Your character’s race grants particular ra- 
cial traits, such as special senses, proficiency with certain 
weapons or tools, proficiency in one or more skills, or the 
ability to use minor spells. These traits sometimes dove- 
tail with the capabilities of certain classes (See step 2). For 
example, the racial traits of lightfoot halflings make them 
exceptional rogues, and high elves tend to be powerful 
wizards. Sometimes playing against type can be fun, too. 


Halfling paladins and mountain dwarf wizards, for exam- 
ple, can be unusual but memorable characters. 

Your race also increases one or more of your ability 
scores, which you determine in step 3. Note these in- 
creases and remember to apply them later. 

Record the traits granted by your race on your 
character sheet. Be sure to note your starting 
languages and your base speed as well. 


BUILDING BRUENOR, STEP | 

Bob is sitting down to create his character. He decides 
that a gruff mountain dwarf fits the character he wants 
to play. He notes all the racial traits of dwarves on his 
character sheet, including his speed of 25 feet and the 
languages he knows: Common and Dwarvish. 


2. CHOOSE A CLASS 


Every adventurer is a member of a class. Class broadly 
describes a character’s vocation, what special talents he 
or she possesses, and the tactics he or she is most likely 
to employ when exploring a dungeon, fighting monsters, 
or engaging in a tense negotiation. The character classes 
are described in chapter 3. 

Your character receives a number of benefits from 
your choice of class. Many of these benefits are class 
features—capabilities (including spellcasting) that set 
your character apart from members of other classes. You 
also gain a number of proficiencies: armor, weapons, 
skills, saving throws, and sometimes tools. Your profi- 
ciencies define many of the things your character can do 
particularly well, from using certain weapons to telling a 
convincing lie. 

On your character sheet, record all the features that 
your class gives you at Ist level. 


LEVEL 

Typically, a character starts at 1st level and advances in 
level by adventuring and gaining experience points (XP). 
A 1st-level character is inexperienced in the adventuring 
world, although he or she might have been a soldier or a 
pirate and done dangerous things before. 

Starting off at 1st level marks your character’s en- 
try into the adventuring life. If you’re already familiar 
with the game, or if you are joining an existing D&amp;D 
campaign, your DM might decide to have you begin at a 
higher level, on the assumption that your character has 
already survived a few harrowing adventures. 

Record your level on your character sheet. If you're 
starting at a higher level, record the additional elements 
your class gives you for your levels past 1st. Also re- 
cord your experience points. A 1st-level character has 
0 XP. A higher-level character typically begins with the 
minimum amount of XP required to reach that level 
(see “Beyond 1st Level” later in this chapter). 


HIT POINTS AND HiT DICE 

Your character’s hit points define how tough your char- 

acter is in combat and other dangerous situations. Your 
hit points are determined by your Hit Dice (short for Hit 
Point Dice). 


CHAPTER 1: STEP-BY-STEP CHARACTERS 





D&amp;D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. P 





»py this document for personal use only 








At 1st level, your character has 1 Hit Die, and the die 
type is determined by your class. You start with hit points 
equal to the highest roll of that die, as indicated in your 
class description. (You also add your Constitution mod- 
ifier, which you'll determine in step 3.) This is also your 
hit point maximum. 

Record your character’s hit points on your character 
sheet. Also record the type of Hit Die your character uses 
and the number of Hit Dice you have. After you rest, you 
can spend Hit Dice to regain hit points (see “Resting” in 
chapter 8). 


PROFICIENCY BONUS 

The table that appears in your class description shows 
your proficiency bonus, which is +2 for a 1st-level 
character. Your proficiency bonus applies to many of the 
numbers you'll be recording on your character sheet: 


« Attack rolls using weapons youre proficient with 

« Attack rolls with spells you cast 

« Ability checks using skills you’re proficient in 

« Ability checks using tools you're proficient with 

« Saving throws youre proficient in 

« Saving throw DCs for spells you cast (explained in each 
spellcasting class) 


Your class determines your weapon proficiencies, your 
saving throw proficiencies, and some of your skill and 
tool proficiencies. (Skills are described in chapter 7, tools 
in chapter 5.) Your background gives you additional skill 
and tool proficiencies, and some races give you more 
proficiencies. Be sure to note all of these proficiencies, as 
well as your proficiency bonus, on your character sheet. 

Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die 
roll or other number more than once. Occasionally, your 
proficiency bonus might be modified (doubled or halved, 
for example) before you apply it. If a circumstance sug- 
gests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once 
to the same roll or that it should be multiplied more than 
once, you nevertheless add it only once, multiply it only 
once, and halve it only once. 


BUILDING BRUENOR, STEP 2 

Bob imagines Bruenor charging into battle with an axe, 
one horn on his helmet broken off. He makes Bruenor a 
fighter and notes the fighter’s proficiencies and 1st-level 
class features on his character sheet. 

As a Ist-level fighter, Bruenor has 1 Hit Die—a d10— 
and starts with hit points equal to 10 + his Constitution 
modifier. Bob notes this, and will record the final number 
after he determines Bruenor’s Constitution score (See 
step 3). Bob also notes the proficiency bonus for a 1st- 
level character, which is +2.

3. DETERMINE ABILITY SCORES 


Much of what your character does in the game depends 
on his or her six abilities: Strength, Dexterity, Constitu- 
tion, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each ability 
has a score, which is a number you record on your char- 
acter sheet. 

The six abilities and their use in the game are de- 
scribed in chapter 7. The Ability Score Summary 
table provides a quick reference for what qualities are 
measured by each ability, what races increases which 
abilities, and what classes consider each ability particu- 
larly important. 

You generate your character’s six ability scores ran- 
domly. Roll four 6-sided dice and record the total of the 
highest three dice on a piece of scratch paper. Do this five 
more times, so that you have six numbers. If you want to 
save time or don’t like the idea of randomly determining 
ability scores, you can use the following scores instead: 
15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8. 

Now take your six numbers and write each number 
beside one of your character's six abilities to assign 
scores to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, 
Wisdom, and Charisma. Afterward, make any changes to 
your ability scores as a result of your race choice. 

After assigning your ability scores, determine your 
ability modifiers using the Ability Scores and Modifiers 
table. To determine an ability modifier without consulting 
the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide 
the result by 2 (round down). Write the modifier next to 
each of your scores. 


BUILDING BRUENOR, STEP 3 
Bob decides to use the standard set of scores (15, 14, 13, 
12, 10, 8) for Bruenor’s abilities. Since he’s a fighter, he 
puts his highest score, 15, in Strength. His next-high- 
est, 14, goes in Constitution. Bruenor might be a brash 
fighter, but Bob decides he wants the dwarf to be older, 
wiser, and a good leader, so he puts decent scores in 
Wisdom and Charisma. After applying his racial ben- 
efits (increasing Bruenor’s Constitution by 2 and his 
Strength by 2), Bruenor’s ability scores and modifiers 
look like this: Strength 17 +3), Dexterity 10 +0), Con- 
stitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 8 (1), Wisdom 13 (+1), 
Charisma 12 (+1). 

Bob fills in Bruenor’s final hit points: 10 + his Constitu- 
tion modifier of +3, for a total of 13 hit points.

VARIANT: CUSTOMIZING ABILITY SCORES 

At your Dungeon Master’s option, you can use this vari- 
ant for determining your ability scores. The method 
described here allows you to build a character with a set 
of ability scores you choose individually. 

You have 27 points to spend on your ability scores. The 
cost of each score is shown on the Ability Score Point 
Cost table. For example, a score of 14 costs 7 points. 
Using this method, 15 is the highest ability score you can 
end up with, before applying racial increases. You can’t 
have a score lower than 8. 

This method of determining ability scores enables you 
to create a set of three high numbers and three low ones 
(15, 15, 15, 8, 8, 8), a set of numbers that are above aver- 
age and nearly equal (13, 13, 13, 12, 12, 12), or any set of 
numbers between those extremes.

4, DESCRIBE YOUR CHARACTER 


Once you know the basic game aspects of your character, 


it’s time to flesh him or her out as a person. Your charac- 
ter needs a name. Spend a few minutes thinking about 
what he or she looks like and how he or she behaves in 
general terms. 

Using the information in chapter 4, you can flesh out 
your character’s physical appearance and personality 
traits. Choose your character’s alignment (the moral 
compass that guides his or her decisions) and ideals. 
Chapter 4 also helps you identify the things your char- 
acter holds most dear, called bonds, and the flaws that 
could one day undermine him or her. 

Your character’s background describes where he or 
she came from, his or her original occupation, and the 
character’s place in the D&amp;D world. Your DM might of- 
fer additional backgrounds beyond the ones included in 
chapter 4, and might be willing to work with you to craft 
a background that’s a more precise fit for your charac- 
ter concept. 

A background gives your character a background 
feature (a general benefit) and proficiency in two skills, 
and it might also give you additional languages or 
proficiency with certain kinds of tools. Record this 
information, along with the personality information 
you develop, on your character sheet. 


YOUR CHARACTER’S ABILITIES 

Take your character’s ability scores and race into account 
as you flesh out his or her appearance and personality. A 
very strong character with low Intelligence might think 
and behave very differently from a very smart character 
with low Strength. 

For example, high Strength usually corresponds 
with a burly or athletic body, while a character with 
low Strength might be scrawny or plump. 

A character with high Dexterity is probably lithe and 
slim, while a character with low Dexterity might be either 
gangly and awkward or heavy and thick-fingered. 

A character with high Constitution usually looks 
healthy, with bright eyes and abundant energy. A charac- 
ter with low Constitution might be sickly or frail. 

A character with high Intelligence might be highly 
inquisitive and studious, while a character with low Intel- 
ligence might speak simply or easily forget details. 

A character with high Wisdom has good judgment, em- 
pathy, and a general awareness of what’s going on. 

A character with low Wisdom might be absent-minded, 
foolhardy, or oblivious. 

A character with high Charisma exudes confidence, 
which is usually mixed with a graceful or intimidating 
presence. A character with a low Charisma might come 
across as abrasive, inarticulate, or timid.

BUILDING BRUENOR, STEP 4 

Bob fills in some of Bruenor’s basic details: his name, his 
sex (male), his height and weight, and his alignment (law- 
ful good). His high Strength and Constitution suggest a 
healthy, athletic body, and his low Intelligence suggests a 
degree of forgetfulness. 

Bob decides that Bruenor comes from a noble line, but 
his clan was expelled from its homeland when Bruenor 
was very young. He grew up working as a smith in the re- 
mote villages of Icewind Dale. But Bruenor has a heroic 
destiny—to reclaim his homeland—so Bob chooses the 
folk hero background for his dwarf. He notes the profi- 
ciencies and special feature this background gives him. 

Bob has a pretty clear picture of Bruenor’s personality 
in mind, so he skips the personality traits suggested in 
the folk hero background, noting instead that Bruenor is 
a caring, sensitive dwarf who genuinely loves his friends 
and allies, but he hides this soft heart behind a gruff, 
snarling demeanor. He chooses the ideal of fairness from 
the list in his background, noting that Bruenor believes 
that no one is above the law. 

Given his history, Bruenor’s bond is obvious: he aspires 
to someday reclaim Mithral Hall, his homeland, from the 
shadow dragon that drove the dwarves out. His flaw is 
tied to his caring, sensitive nature—he has a soft spot for 
orphans and wayward souls, leading him to show mercy 
even when it might not be warranted. 


5. CHOOSE EQUIPMENT 


Your class and background determine your character's 
starting equipment, including weapons, armor, and 
other adventuring gear. Record this equipment on your 
character sheet. All such items are detailed in chapter 5, 
“Equipment.* 

Instead of taking the gear given to you by your class 
and background, you can purchase your starting equip- 
ment. You have a number of gold pieces (gp) to spend 
based on your class, as shown in chapter 5. Extensive 
lists of equipment, with prices, also appear in that chap- 
ter. If you wish, you can also have one trinket at no cost 
(see the Trinkets table at the end of chapter 5). 

Your Strength score limits the amount of gear you can 
carry. Try not to purchase equipment with a total weight 
(in pounds) exceeding your Strength score times 15. 
Chapter 7 has more information on carrying capacity. 


ARMOR CLASS 
Your Armor Class (AC) represents how well your 
character avoids being wounded in battle. Things that 
contribute to your AC include the armor you wear, the 
shield you carry, and your Dexterity modifier. Not all 
characters wear armor or carry shields, however. 
Without armor or a shield, your character’s AC equals 
10 + his or her Dexterity modifier. If your character 
wears armor, carries a shield, or both, calculate your 
AC using the rules in chapter 5. Record your AC on 
your character sheet. 


Your character needs to be proficient with armor and 
shields to wear and use them effectively, and your armor 
and shield proficiencies are determined by your class. 
There are drawbacks to wearing armor or carrying a 
shield if you lack the required proficiency, as explained in 
chapter 5. 

Some spells and class features give you a different way 
to calculate your AC. If you have multiple features that 
give you different ways to calculate your AC, you choose 
which one to use. 


WEAPONS 
For each weapon your character wields, calculate the 
modifier you use when you attack with the weapon and 
the damage you deal when you hit. 

When you make an attack with a weapon, you roll 
a d20 and add your proficiency bonus (but only if you 
are proficient with the weapon) and the appropriate 
ability modifier. 


- For attacks with melee weapons, use your Strength 
modifier for attack and damage rolls. A weapon that 
has the finesse property, such as a rapier, can use your 
Dexterity modifier instead. 

- For attacks with ranged weapons, use your Dexterity 
modifier for attack and damage rolls. A melee weapon 
that has the thrown property, such as a handaxe, can 
use your Strength modifier instead. 


BUILDING BRUENOR, STEP 5 
Bob writes down the starting equipment from the fighter 
class and the folk hero background. His starting equip- 
ment includes chain mail and a shield, which combine to 
give Bruenor an Armor Class of 18. 

For Bruenor’s weapons, Bob chooses a battleaxe 
and two handaxes. His battleaxe is a melee weapon, so 
Bruenor uses his Strength modifier for his attacks and 
damage. His attack bonus is his Strength modifier (+3) 
plus his proficiency bonus (+2), for a total of +5. The bat- 
tleaxe deals 1d8 slashing damage, and Bruenor adds his 
Strength modifier to the damage when he hits, for a total 
of 1d8 + 3 slashing damage. When throwing a handaxe, 
Bruenor has the same attack bonus (handaxes, as thrown 
weapons, use Strength for attacks and damage), and the 
weapon deals 1d6 + 3 slashing damage when it hits. 


6. COME TOGETHER 


Most D&amp;D characters don’t work alone. Each charac- 

ter plays a role within a party, a group of adventurers 
working together for a common purpose. Teamwork 

and cooperation greatly improve your party’s chances 

to survive the many perils in the worlds of DUNGEONS &amp; 
DRAGONS. Talk to your fellow players and your DM to de- 
cide whether your characters know one another, how they 
met, and what sorts of quests the group might undertake.

RICHARD WHITTERS 


BEYOND IST LEVEL 


As your character goes on adventures and overcomes 
challenges, he or she gains experience, represented by 
experience points. A character who reaches a specified 
experience point total advances in capability. This ad- 
vancement is called gaining a level. 

When your character gains a level, his or her class 
often grants additional features, as detailed in the class 
description. Some of these features allow you to increase 
your ability scores, either increasing two scores by 1 each 
or increasing one score by 2. You can’t increase an ability 
score above 20. In addition, every character’s proficiency 
bonus increases at certain levels. 

Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit 
Die. Roll that Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier 
to the roll, and add the total (minimum of 1) to your hit 
point maximum. Alternatively, you can use the fixed value 
shown in your class entry, which is the average result of 
the die roll (rounded up). 

When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your 
hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have 
attained. For example, when Bruenor reaches 8th level as 
a fighter, he increases his Constitution score from 17 to 
18, thus increasing his Constitution modifier from +3 to 
+4. His hit point maximum then increases by 8. 

The Character Advancement table summarizes the 
XP you need to advance in levels from level 1 through 
level 20, and the proficiency bonus for a character of that 
level. Consult the information in your character’s class 
description to see what other improvements you gain at 
each level. 


TIERS OF PLAY 


The shading in the Character Advancement table shows the 
four tiers of play. The tiers don’t have any rules associated 
with them; they are a general description of how the play 
experience changes as characters gain levels. 





In the first tier (levels 1-4), characters are effectively 
apprentice adventurers. They are learning the features 
that define them as members of particular classes, in- 
cluding the major choices that flavor their class features 
as they advance (Such as a wizard’s Arcane Tradition ora 
fighter’s Martial Archetype). The threats they face are rel- 
atively minor, usually posing a danger to local farmsteads 
or villages. 

In the second tier (levels 5-10), characters come into 
their own. Many spellcasters gain access to 3rd-level 
spells at the start of this tier, crossing a new threshold 
of magical power with spells such as fireball and light- 
ning bolt. At this tier, many weapon-using classes gain 
the ability to make multiple attacks in one round. These 
characters have become important, facing dangers that 
threaten cities and kingdoms. 

In the third tier (levels 11-16), characters have reached 
a level of power that sets them high above the ordinary 
populace and makes them special even among adven- 
turers. At 11th level, many spellcasters gain access to 
6th-level spells, some of which create effects previously 
impossible for player characters to achieve. Other charac- 
ters gain features that allow them to make more attacks 
or do more impressive things with those attacks. These 
mighty adventurers often confront threats to whole re- 
gions and continents. 

At the fourth tier (levels 17-20), characters achieve 
the pinnacle of their class features, becoming heroic (or 
villainous) archetypes in their own right. The fate of the 
world or even the fundamental order of the multiverse 
might hang in the balance during their adventures.

CHAPTER 2: RACES 


A VISIT TO ONE OF THE GREAT CITIES IN THE WORLDS OF 
DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS—Waterdeep, the Free City of 
Greyhawk, or even uncanny Sigil, the City of Doors— 
overwhelms the senses. Voices chatter in countless 
different languages. The smells of cooking in dozens 

of different cuisines mingle with the odors of crowded 
streets and poor sanitation. Buildings in myriad ar- 
chitectural styles display the diverse origins of their 
inhabitants. 

And the people themselves—people of varying size, 
shape, and color, dressed in a dazzling spectrum of styles 
and hues—represent many different races, from diminu- 
tive halflings and stout dwarves to majestically beautiful 
elves, mingling among a variety of human ethnicities. 

Scattered among the members of these more common 
races are the true exotics: a hulking dragonborn here, 
pushing his way through the crowd, and a sly tiefling 
there, lurking in the shadows with mischief in her eyes. A 
group of gnomes laughs as one of them activates a clever 
wooden toy that moves of its own accord. Half-elves and 
half-orcs live and work alongside humans, without fully 
belonging to the races of either of their parents. And 
there, well out of the sunlight, is a lone drow—a fugitive 
from the subterranean expanse of the Underdark, try- 
ing to make his way in a world that fears his kind. The 
Player’s Handbook has more information about these 
unusual races. 


CHOOSING A RACE 


Humans are the most common people in the worlds of 
D&amp;D, but they live and work alongside dwarves, elves, 
halflings, and countless other fantastic species. Your 
character belongs to one of these peoples. 

Not every intelligent race of the multiverse is appropri- 
ate for a player-controlled adventurer. Dwarves, elves, 
halflings, and humans are the most common races to 
produce the sort of adventurers who make up typical 
parties. Other races and subraces are less common as 
adventurers. 

Your choice of race affects many different aspects of 
your character. It establishes fundamental qualities that 
exist throughout your character’s adventuring career. 
When making this decision, keep in mind the kind of 
character you want to play. For example, a halfling could 
be a good choice for a sneaky rogue, a dwarf makes a 
tough warrior, and an elf can be a master of arcane magic. 

Your character race not only affects your ability scores 
and traits but also provides the cues for building your 
character’s story. Each race’s description in this chapter 
includes information to help you roleplay a character of 
that race, including personality, physical appearance, fea- 
tures of society, and racial alignment tendencies. These 
details are suggestions to help you think about your char- 
acter; adventurers can deviate widely from the norm for 
their race. It’s worthwhile to consider why your character 
is different, as a helpful way to think about your charac- 
ter’s background and personality. 


RACIAL TRAITS 


The description of each race includes racial traits that are 
common to members of that race. The following entries 
appear among the traits of most races. 


ABILITY SCORE INCREASE 
Every race increases one or more of a character’s abil- 
ity scores. 


AGE 

The age entry notes the age when a member of the race 
is considered an adult, as well as the race’s expected 
lifespan. This information can help you decide how old 
your character is at the start of the game. You can choose 
any age for your character, which could provide an ex- 
planation for some of your ability scores. For example, 

if you play a young or very old character, your age could 
explain a particularly low Strength or Constitution score, 
while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence 
or Wisdom. 


ALIGNMENT 

Most races have tendencies toward certain alignments, 
described in this entry. These are not binding for player 
characters, but considering why your dwarf is chaotic, for 
example, in defiance of lawful dwarf society can help you 
better define your character. 


SIZE 

Characters of most races are Medium, a size category 
including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Mem- 
bers of a few races are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), 
which means that certain rules of the game affect them 
differently. The most important of these rules is that 
Small characters have trouble wielding heavy weapons, 
as explained in chapter 5. 


SPEED 
Your speed determines how far you can move when trav- 
eling (chapter 8) and fighting (chapter 9). 


LANGUAGES 

By virtue of your race, your character can speak, read, 
and write certain languages. Chapter 4 lists the most 
common languages of the D&amp;D multiverse. 


SUBRACES 

Some races have subraces. Members of a subrace have 
the traits of the parent race in addition to the traits speci- 
fied for their subrace. Relationships among subraces vary 
significantly from race to race and world to world. In the 
Dragonlance campaign setting, for example, mountain 
dwarves and hill dwarves live together as different clans 
of the same people, but in the Forgotten Realms, they live 
far apart in separate kingdoms and call themselves shield 
dwarves and gold dwarves, respectively.

DWARF 


“YER LATE, ELF!” CAME THE ROUGH EDGE OF A FAMILIAR 
voice. Bruenor Battlehammer walked up the back of his 
dead foe, disregarding the fact that the heavy monster lay 
on top of his elven friend. In spite of the added discomfort, 
the dwarf’s long, pointed, often-broken nose and gray- 
streaked though still-fiery red beard came as a welcome 
sight to Drizzt. “Knew I'd find ye in trouble if I came out 
an’ looked for ye!” 

—R. A. Salvatore, The Crystal Shard 


Kingdoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the 
roots of mountains, the echoing of picks and hammers 
in deep mines and blazing forges, a commitment to clan 
and tradition, and a burning hatred of goblins and orcs— 
these common threads unite all dwarves. 


SHORT AND STOUT 


Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, 


miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though they 
stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and 
compact that they can weigh as much as a human standing 
nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are 
also easily a match for any of the larger folk. 

Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler 
hue tinged with red, but the most common shades are 
light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth. 
Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is usually 
black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have 
red hair. Male dwarves value their beards highly and 
groom them carefully. 


Lonc MEMory, LONG GRUDGES 


Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the 
oldest living dwarves often remember a very different 
world. For example, some of the oldest dwarves living 

in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of the Forgotten Realms) 
can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when 
orcs conquered the fortress and drove them into an exile 
that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a 
perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as 
humans and halflings lack. 

Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains 
they love, weathering the passage of centuries with stoic 
endurance and little change. They respect the traditions 
of their clans, tracing their ancestry back to the found- 
ing of their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the 
world, and don’t abandon those traditions lightly. Part of 
those traditions is devotion to the gods of the dwarves, 
who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill 
in battle, and devotion to the forge. 

Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to 
their word and decisive in action, sometimes to the point 
of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense of 
justice, and they are slow to forget wrongs they have suf- 
fered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the 
dwarf’s entire clan, so what begins as one dwarf’s hunt 
for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.

CLANS AND KINGDOMS 


Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains 
where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals and 
forge items of wonder. They love the beauty and artistry 
of precious metals and fine jewelry, and in some dwarves 
this love festers into avarice. Whatever wealth they can’t 
find in their mountains, they gain through trade. They 
dislike boats, so enterprising humans and halflings 
frequently handle trade in dwarven goods along water 
routes. Trustworthy members of other races are welcome 
in dwarf settlements, though some areas are off limits 
even to them. 

The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and 
dwarves highly value social standing. Even dwarves 
who live far from their own kingdoms cherish their clan 
identities and affiliations, recognize related dwarves, and 
invoke their ancestors’ names in oaths and curses. To be 
clanless is the worst fate that can befall a dwarf. 

Dwarves in other lands are typically artisans, espe- 
cially weaponsmiths, armorers, and jewelers. Some 
become mercenaries or bodyguards, highly sought after 
for their courage and loyalty. 


Gops, GOLD, AND CLAN 


Dwarves who take up the adventuring life might be 
motivated by a desire for treasure—for its own sake, for 

a specific purpose, or even out of an altruistic desire to 
help others. Other dwarves are driven by the command 
or inspiration of a deity, a direct calling or simply a desire 
to bring glory to one of the dwarf gods. Clan and ancestry 
are also important motivators. A dwarf might seek to 
restore a clan’s lost honor, avenge an ancient wrong the 
clan suffered, or earn a new place within the clan after 


ee 
SLow TO TRUST 


Dwarves get along passably well with most other races. 

“The difference between an acquaintance and a friend is 
about a hundred years,” is a dwarf saying that might be 

hyperbole, but certainly points to how difficult it can be 

for a member of a short-lived race like humans to earn a 
dwarf’s trust. 

Elves. “It’s not wise to depend on the elves. No telling 
what an elf will do next; when the hammer meets the orc’s 
head, they’re as apt to start singing as to pull out a sword. 
They’re flighty and frivolous. Two things to be said for them, 
though: They don’t have many smiths, but the ones they 
have do very fine work. And when orcs or goblins come 
streaming down out of the mountains, an elf’s good to have 
at your back. Not as good as a dwarf, maybe, but no doubt 
they hate the orcs as much as we do.” 

Halflings. “Sure, they’re pleasant folk. But show me 
a halfling hero. An empire, a triumphant army. Even a 
treasure for the ages made by halfling hands. Nothing. How 
can you take them seriously?” 

Humans. “You take the time to get to know a human, 
and by then the human's on her deathbed. If you’re lucky, 
she’s got kin—a daughter or granddaughter, maybe—who’s 
got hands and heart as good as hers. That’s when you can 
make a human friend. And watch them go! They set their 
hearts on something, they'll get it, whether it’s a dragon’s 
hoard or an empire’s throne. You have to admire that 
kind of dedication, even if it gets them in trouble more 
often than not.”

DwARF NAMES 


A dwarf’s name is granted by a clan elder, in accordance 


with tradition. Every proper dwarven name has been 
used and reused down through the generations. A 
dwarf’s name belongs to the clan, not to the individual. 
A dwarf who misuses or brings shame to a clan name 
is stripped of the name and forbidden by law to use any 
dwarven name in its place.

DwARF TRAITS 


Your dwarf character has an assortment of inborn abili- 
ties, part and parcel of dwarven nature. 

Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score in- 
creases by 2. 

Age. Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but 
they're considered young until they reach the age of 50. 
On average, they live about 350 years. 

Alignment. Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly 
in the benefits of a well-ordered society. They tend to- 
ward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and a 
belief that everyone deserves to share in the benefits of a 
just order. 

Size. Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and aver- 
age about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium. 

Speed. Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed 
is not reduced by wearing heavy armor. 

Darkvision. Accustomed to life underground, you have 
superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see 
in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, 
and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern 
color in darkness, only shades of gray. 

Dwarven Resilience. You have advantage on saving 
throws against poison, and you have resistance against 
poison damage (explained in chapter 9). 

Dwarven Combat Training. You have proficiency with 
the battleaxe, handaxe, light hammer, and warhammer. 

Tool Proficiency. You gain proficiency with the arti- 
san’s tools of your choice: smith’s tools, brewer’s supplies, 
or mason’s tools. 

Stonecunning. Whenever you make an Intelligence 
(History) check related to the origin of stonework, you are 
considered proficient in the History skill and add double 
your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your nor- 
mal proficiency bonus.

DUERGAR 

In cities deep in the Underdark live the duergar, or gray 

dwarves. These vicious, stealthy slave traders raid the 

surface world for captives, then sell their prey to the other 

races of the Underdark. They have innate magical abilities 

to become invisible and to temporarily grow to giant size. 
Sn 

Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common 
and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and 
guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into 
whatever other language a dwarf might speak. 

Subrace. Two main subraces of dwarves populate the 
worlds of D&amp;D: hill dwarves and mountain dwarves. 
Choose one of these subraces. 


HILL DWARF 
As a hill dwarf, you have keen senses, deep intuition, and 
remarkable resilience. The gold dwarves of Faerfin in 
their mighty southern kingdom are hill dwarves, as are 
the exiled Neidar and the debased Klar of Krynn in the 
Dragonlance setting. 

Ability Score Increase. Your Wisdom score in- 
creases by 1. 

Dwarven Toughness. Your hit point maximum 
increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you 
gain a level. 


MOUNTAIN DWARF 
As a mountain dwarf, you're strong and hardy, accus- 
tomed to a difficult life in rugged terrain. You’re probably 
on the tall side (for a dwarf), and tend toward lighter col- 
oration. The shield dwarves of northern Faerfin, as well 
as the ruling Hylar clan and the noble Daewar clan of 
Dragonlance, are mountain dwarves. 

Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score in- 
creases by 2. 

Dwarven Armor Training. You have proficiency with 
light and medium armor. 


ELF 


“I HAVE NEVER IMAGINED SUCH BEAUTY EXISTED,” 
Goldmoon said softly. The day’s march had been difficult, but 
the reward at the end was beyond their dreams. 

The companions stood on a high cliff over the fabled 

city of Qualinost. 

Four slender spires rose from the city’s corners like glisten- 
ing spindles, their brilliant white stone marbled with shining 
silver. Graceful arches, swooping from spire to spire, soared 
through the air. Crafted by ancient dwarven metalsmiths, 
they were strong enough to hold the weight of an army, yet 
they appeared so delicate that a bird lighting on them might 
overthrow the balance. These glistening arches were the city’s 
only boundaries; there was no wall around Qualinost. The 
elven city opened its arms lovingly to the wilderness. 

—Margaret Weis &amp; Tracy Hickman, 
Dragons of Autumn Twilight 


CHAPTER 2: RACES 





ed to print and photocopy this document for personal use only 








Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living 
in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in places 
of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in 
silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music 
drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the 
breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, mu- 
sic and poetry, and the good things of the world. 


SLENDER AND GRACEFUL 


With their unearthly grace and fine features, elves appear 


hauntingly beautiful to humans and members of many 
other races. They are slightly shorter than humans on 
average, ranging from well under 5 feet tall to just over 
6 feet. They are more slender than humans, weighing 
only 100 to 145 pounds. Males and females are about 
the same height, and males are only marginally heavier 
than females. 

Elves’ coloration encompasses the normal human 
range and also includes skin in shades of copper, bronze, 
and almost bluish-white, hair of green or blue, and eyes 
like pools of liquid gold or silver. Elves have no facial and 
little body hair. They favor elegant clothing in bright col- 
ors, and they enjoy simple yet lovely jewelry. 


A TIMELESS PERSPECTIVE 


Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad 
perspective on events that might trouble the shorter-lived 
races more deeply. They are more often amused than 
excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy. They 
tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance. 
When pursuing a goal, however, whether adventuring 
on a mission or learning a new skill or art, elves can be 
focused and relentless. They are slow to make friends 
and enemies, and even slower to forget them. They reply 
to petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with 
vengeance. 

Like the branches of a young tree, elves are flexible 
in the face of danger. They trust in diplomacy and com- 
promise to resolve differences before they escalate to 
violence. They have been known to retreat from intru- 
sions into their woodland homes, confident that they can 
simply wait the invaders out. But when the need arises, 
elves reveal a stern martial side, demonstrating skill with 
sword, bow, and strategy. 


HIDDEN WOODLAND REALMS 


Most elves dwell in small forest villages hidden among 
the trees. Elves hunt game, gather food, and grow vege- 
tables, and their skill and magic allow them to support 
themselves without the need for clearing and plowing 
land. They are talented artisans, crafting finely worked 
clothes and art objects. Their contact with outsiders is 
usually limited, though a few elves make a good living by 
trading crafted items for metals (which they have no inter- 
est in mining). 

Elves encountered outside their own lands are com- 
monly traveling minstrels, artists, or sages. Human 
nobles compete for the services of elf instructors to teach 
swordplay or magic to their children. 


te, 
HAUGHTY BUT GRACIOUS 
Although they can be haughty, elves are generally gracious 
even to those who fall short of their high expectations— 
which is most non-elves. Still, they can find good in just 
about anyone. 

Dwarves. “Dwarves are dull, clumsy oafs. But what they 
lack in humor, sophistication, and manners, they make up 
in valor. And | must admit, their best smiths produce art 
that approaches elven quality.” 

Halflings. “Halflings are people of simple pleasures, and 
that is not a quality to scorn. They’re good folk, they care 
for each other and tend their gardens, and they have proven 
themselves tougher than they seem when the need arises.” 

Humans. “All that haste, their ambition and drive to 
accomplish something before their brief lives pass away— 
human endeavors seem so futile sometimes. But then 
you look at what they have accomplished, and you have to 
appreciate their achievements. If only they could slow down 
and learn some refinement.” 





EXPLORATION AND ADVENTURE 


Elves take up adventuring out of wanderlust. Since they 
are so long-lived, they can enjoy centuries of exploration 
and discovery. They dislike the pace of human society, 
which is regimented from day to day but constantly 
changing over decades, so they find careers that let them 
travel freely and set their own pace. Elves also enjoy 
exercising their martial prowess or gaining greater mag- 
ical power, and adventuring allows them to do so. Some 
might join with rebels fighting against oppression, and 
others might become champions of moral causes. 


ELF NAMES 


Elves are considered children until they declare them- 
selves adults, some time after the hundredth birthday, 
and before this period they are called by child names. 
On declaring adulthood, an elf selects an adult name, 
although those who knew him or her as a youngster 
might continue to use the child name. Each elf’s adult 
name is a unique creation, though it might reflect the 
names of respected individuals or other family members. 
Little distinction exists between male names and 
female names; the groupings here reflect only general 
tendencies. In addition, every elf bears a family name, 
typically a combination of other Elvish words. Some elves 
traveling among humans translate their family names 
into Common, but others retain the Elvish version. 


Child Names: Ara, Bryn, Del, Eryn, Faen, Innil, 
Lael, Mella, Naill, Naeris, Phann, Rael, Rinn, Sai,

ELF TRAITS 


Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities, the 
result of thousands of years of elven refinement. 

Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score in- 
creases by 2. 

Age. Although elves reach physical maturity at about 
the same age as humans, the elven understanding of 
adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass 
worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood 
and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live 
to be 750 years old. 

Alignment. Elves love freedom, variety, and self-ex- 
pression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects 
of chaos. They value and protect others’ freedom as well 
as their own, and they are more often good than not. 

Size. Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and 
have slender builds. Your size is Medium. 

Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. 

Darkvision. Accustomed to twilit forests and the night 
sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. 
You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were 
bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You 
can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. 

Keen Senses. You have proficiency in the Percep- 
tion skill. 

Fey Ancestry. You have advantage on saving throws 
against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep. 

Trance. Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they medi- 
tate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. 
(The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) 
While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such 
dreams are actually mental exercises that have become 
reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this 
way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 
hours of sleep. 

Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common 
and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and 
intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and 
their songs and poems are famous among other races. 
Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish 
ballads to their repertoires. 


re 
THE DARKNESS OF THE Drow 


Were it not for one renowned exception, the race of drow 
would be universally reviled. Their depraved society is 
preoccupied with the favor of Lolth, their spider-goddess, 
who sanctions murder and the extermination of entire 
families as noble houses vie for position. Drow grow 

up believing that surface-dwelling races are worthless 
except as slaves. 

Yet one drow, at least, broke the mold. In the world of the 
Forgotten Realms, Drizzt Do’Urden, ranger of the North, 
has proven his quality as a good-hearted defender of the 
weak and innocent. 


Subrace. Ancient divides among the elven people re- 
sulted in three main subraces: high elves, wood elves, 
and dark elves, who are commonly called drow. This 
document presents two of these subraces to choose 
from. In some worlds, these subraces are divided still 
further (such as the sun elves and moon elves of the 
Forgotten Realms), so if you wish, you can choose a nar- 
rower subrace. 


HicH ELF 

As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of 

at least the basics of magic. In many of the worlds of 
D&amp;D, there are two kinds of high elves. One type (which 
includes the gray elves and valley elves of Greyhawk, 
the Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the sun elves of the 
Forgotten Realms) is haughty and reclusive, believing 
themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other 
elves. The other type (including the high elves of Grey- 
hawk, the Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the moon elves 
of the Forgotten Realms) are more common and more 
friendly, and often encountered among humans and 
other races. 

The sun elves of Faerfin (also called gold elves or sun- 
rise elves) have bronze skin and hair of copper, black, 
or golden blond. Their eyes are golden, silver, or black. 
Moon elves (also called silver elves or gray elves) are 
much paler, with alabaster skin sometimes tinged with 
blue. They often have hair of silver-white, black, or blue, 
but various shades of blond, brown, and red are not 
uncommon. Their eyes are blue or green and flecked 
with gold. 

Ability Score Increase. Your Intelligence score in- 
creases by 1. 

Elf Weapon Training. You have proficiency with the 
longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow. 

Cantrip. You know one cantrip of your choice from the 
wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting abil- 
ity for it. 

Extra Language. You can speak, read, and write one 
extra language of your choice. 


Woop ELF 

As a wood elf, you have keen senses and intuition, and 
your fleet feet carry you quickly and stealthily through 
your native forests. This category includes the wild elves 
(grugach) of Greyhawk and the Kagonesti of Dragon- 
lance, as well as the races called wood elves in Greyhawk 
and the Forgotten Realms. In Faerfin, wood elves (also 
called wild elves, green elves, or forest elves) are reclu- 
sive and distrusting of non-elves. 

Wood elves’ skin tends to be copperish in hue, some- 
times with traces of green. Their hair tends toward 
browns and blacks, but it is occasionally blond or cop- 
per-colored. Their eyes are green, brown, or hazel. 

Ability Score Increase. Your Wisdom score in- 
creases by 1. 

Elf Weapon Training. You have proficiency with the 
longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow. 

Fleet of Foot. Your base walking speed increases 
to 35 feet. 

Mask of the Wild. You can attempt to hide even when 
you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, fall- 
ing snow, mist, and other natural phenomena. 





CHAPTER 2: RACES 











HALFLING 


REGIS THE HALFLING, THE ONLY ONE OF HIS KIND FOR 
hundreds of miles in any direction, locked his fingers behind 
his head and leaned back against the mossy blanket of the 
tree trunk. Regis was short, even by the standards of his 
diminutive race, with the fluff of his curly brown locks barely 
cresting the three-foot mark, but his belly was amply thick- 
ened by his love of a good meal, or several, as the opportu- 
nities presented themselves. The crooked stick that served as 
his fishing pole rose up above him, clenched between two of 
his toes, and hung out over the quiet lake, mirrored perfectly 
in the glassy surface of Maer Dualdon. 

—R.A. Salvatore, The Crystal Shard 


The comforts of home are the goals of most halflings’ 
lives: a place to settle in peace and quiet, far from ma- 
rauding monsters and clashing armies; a blazing fire 
and a generous meal; fine drink and fine conversation. 
Though some halflings live out their days in remote ag- 
ricultural communities, others form nomadic bands that 
travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide 
horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and peo- 
ples. But even these wanderers love peace, food, hearth, 
and home, though home might be a wagon jostling along 
an dirt road or a raft floating downriver. 


SMALL AND PRACTICAL 


The diminutive halflings survive in a world full of larger 
creatures by avoiding notice or, barring that, avoiding 
offense. Standing about 3 feet tall, they appear relatively 
harmless and so have managed to survive for centuries 
in the shadow of empires and on the edges of wars and 
political strife. They are inclined to be stout, weighing 
between 40 and 45 pounds. 

Halflings’ skin ranges from tan to pale with a ruddy 
cast, and their hair is usually brown or sandy brown and 
wavy. They have brown or hazel eyes. Halfling men often 
sport long sideburns, but beards are rare among them 
and mustaches even more so. They like to wear simple, 
comfortable, and practical clothes, favoring bright colors. 

Halfling practicality extends beyond their clothing. 
They’re concerned with basic needs and simple pleasures 
and have little use for ostentation. Even the wealthiest 
of halflings keep their treasures locked in a cellar rather 
than on display for all to see. They have 
a knack for finding the most straightforward solution 
to a problem, and have little patience for dithering. 


KIND AND CURIOUS 


Halflings are an affable and cheerful people. They 
cherish the bonds of family and friendship as well 

as the comforts of hearth and home, harboring few 
dreams of gold or glory. Even adventurers among 
them usually venture into the world for reasons of 
community, friendship, wanderlust, or curiosity. They 
love discovering new things, even simple things, such 
as an exotic food or an unfamiliar style of clothing. 


Halflings are easily moved to pity and hate to see any 
living thing suffer. They are generous, happily sharing 
what they have even in lean times. 


BLEND INTO THE CROWD 


Halflings are adept at fitting into a community of hu- 
mans, dwarves, or elves, making themselves valuable 
and welcome. The combination of their inherent stealth 
and their unassuming nature helps halflings to avoid un- 
wanted attention. 

Halflings work readily with others, and they are loyal 
to their friends, whether halfling or otherwise. They can 
display remarkable ferocity when their friends, families, 
or communities are threatened. 


PASTORAL PLEASANTRIES 


Most halflings live in small, peaceful communities with 
large farms and well-kept groves. They rarely build 
kingdoms of their own or even hold much land beyond 
their quiet shires. They typically don’t recognize any sort 
of halfling nobility or royalty, instead looking to family 
elders to guide them. Families preserve their traditional 
ways despite the rise and fall of empires. 

Many halflings live among other races, where the 
halflings’ hard work and loyal outlook offer them abun- 
dant rewards and creature comforts. Some halfling 
communities travel as a way of life, driving wagons or 
guiding boats from place to place and maintaining no 
permanent home. 


EXPLORING OPPORTUNITIES 


Halflings usually set out on the adventurer’s path to de- 
fend their communities, support their friends, or explore 
a wide and wonder-filled world. For them, adventuring 
is less a career than an opportunity or sometimes a 
necessity. 


HALFLING NAMES 


A halfling has a given name, a family name, and possibly 
a nickname. Family names are often nicknames that 
stuck so tenaciously they have been passed down through 
the generations. 


Male Names: Alton, Ander, Cade, Corrin, Eldon, Errich, 
Finnan, Garret, Lindal, Lyle, Merric, Milo, Osborn, 
Perrin, Reed, Roscoe, Wellby 

Female Names: Andry, Bree, Callie, Cora, Euphemia, 
Jillian, Kithri, Lavinia, Lidda, Merla, Nedda, Paela, 
Portia, Seraphina, Shaena, Trym, Vani, Verna 

Family Names: Brushgather, Goodbarrel, Greenbottle, 
High-hill, Hilltopple, Leagallow, Tealeaf, Thorngage, 
Tosscobble, Underbough 


HALFLING TRAITS 


Your halfling character has a number of traits in common 
with all other halflings. 

Ability Score Increase. Your Dexterity score in- 
creases by 2. 

Age. A halfling reaches adulthood at the age of 20 
and generally lives into the middle of his or her sec- 
ond century.

Alignment. Most halflings are lawful good. As a rule, 
they are good-hearted and kind, hate to see others in 
pain, and have no tolerance for oppression. They are 
also very orderly and traditional, leaning heavily on 
the support of their community and the comfort of 
their old ways. 

Size. Halflings average about 3 feet tall and weigh 
about 40 pounds. Your size is Small. 

Speed. Your base walking speed is 25 feet. 

Lucky. When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, 
ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and 
must use the new roll. 

Brave. You have advantage on saving throws against 
being frightened. 

Halfling Nimbleness. You can move through the space 
of any creature that is of a size larger than yours. 

Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common 
and Halfling. The Halfling language isn’t secret, but 
halflings are loath to share it with others. They write 
very little, so they don’t have a rich body of literature. 
Their oral tradition, however, is very strong. Almost all 
halflings speak Common to converse with the people 
in whose lands they dwell or through which they are 
traveling. 

Subrace. The two main kinds of halfling, lightfoot and 
stout, are more like closely related families than true sub- 
races. Choose one of these subraces. 


LIGHTFOOT 

As a lightfoot halfling, you can easily hide from notice, 
even using other people as cover. You’re inclined to be 
affable and get along well with others. In the Forgotten 
Realms, lightfoot halflings have spread the farthest and 
thus are the most common variety. 

Lightfoots are more prone to wanderlust than other hal- 
flings, and often dwell alongside other races or take up a 
nomadic life. In the world of Greyhawk, these halflings 
are called hairfeet or tallfellows. 

Ability Score Increase. Your Charisma score in- 
creases by 1. 

Naturally Stealthy. You can attempt to hide even when 
you are obscured only by a creature that is at least one 
size larger than you. 


STOUT 
As a stout halfling, you’re hardier than average and have 
some resistance to poison. Some say that stouts have 
dwarven blood. In the Forgotten Realms, these halflings 
are called stronghearts, and they’re most common in 
the south. 

Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score in- 
creases by 1. 

Stout Resilience. You have advantage on saving 
throws against poison, and you have resistance against 
poison damage. 


sss 
AFFABLE AND POSITIVE 
Halflings try to get along with everyone else and are loath to 
make sweeping generalizations—especially negative ones. 

Dwarves. “Dwarves make loyal friends, and you can count 
on them to keep their word. But would it hurt them to smile 
once in a while?” 

Elves. “They’re so beautiful! Their faces, their music, 
their grace and all. It’s like they stepped out of a wonderful 
dream. But there’s no telling what’s going on behind their 
smiling faces—surely more than they ever let on.” 

Humans. “Humans are a lot like us, really. At least some 
of them are. Step out of the castles and keeps, go talk to 
the farmers and herders and you'll find good, solid folk. Not 
that there’s anything wrong with the barons and soldiers— 
you have to admire their conviction. And by protecting their 
own lands, they protect us as well.” 





HUMAN 


THESE WERE THE STORIES OF A RESTLESS PEOPLE WHO 
long ago took to the seas and rivers in longboats, first to 
pillage and terrorize, then to settle. Yet there was an energy, 
a love of adventure, that sang from every page. Long into the 
night Liriel read, lighting candle after precious candle. 

She'd never given much thought to humans, but these sto- 
ries fascinated her. In these yellowed pages were tales of bold 
heroes, strange and fierce animals, mighty primitive gods, and 
a magic that was part and fabric of that distant land. 

—Elaine Cunningham, Daughter of the Drow 


In the reckonings of most worlds, humans are the young- 
est of the common races, late to arrive on the world scene 
and short-lived in comparison to dwarves, elves, and 
dragons. Perhaps it is because of their shorter lives that 
they strive to achieve as much as they can in the years 
they are given. Or maybe they feel they have something 
to prove to the elder races, and that’s why they build their 
mighty empires on the foundation of conquest and trade. 
Whatever drives them, humans are the innovators, the 
achievers, and the pioneers of the worlds. 


A BROAD SPECTRUM 


With their penchant for migration and conquest, humans 
are more physically diverse than other common races. 
There is no typical human. An individual can stand from 
5 feet to a little over 6 feet tall and weigh from 125 to 250 
pounds. Human skin shades range from nearly black 

to very pale, and hair colors from black to blond (curly, 
kinky, or straight); males might sport facial hair that is 
sparse or thick. A lot of humans have a dash of nonhu- 
man blood, revealing hints of elf, orc, or other lineages. 
Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and rarely 
live even a single century. 


CHAPTER 2: RACES 














VARIETY IN ALL THINGS 


Humans are the most adaptable and ambitious people 
among the common races. They have widely varying 
tastes, morals, and customs in the many different lands 
where they have settled. When they settle, though, they 
stay: they build cities to last for the ages, and great king- 
doms that can persist for long centuries. An individual 
human might have a relatively short life span, but a hu- 
man nation or culture preserves traditions with origins 
far beyond the reach of any single human’s memory. They 
live fully in the present—making them well suited to the 
adventuring life—but also plan for the future, striving to 
leave a lasting legacy. Individually and as a group, hu- 
mans are adaptable opportunists, and they stay alert to 
changing political and social dynamics. 


LASTING INSTITUTIONS 


Where a single elf or dwarf might take on the responsi- 
bility of guarding a special location or a powerful secret, 
humans found sacred orders and institutions for such 
purposes. While dwarf clans and halfling elders pass on 
the ancient traditions to each new generation, human 
temples, governments, libraries, and codes of law fix 
their traditions in the bedrock of history. Humans dream 
of immortality, but (except for those few who seek un- 
death or divine ascension to escape death’s clutches) they 
achieve it by ensuring that they will be remembered when 
they are gone. 

Although some humans can be xenophobic, in general 
their societies are inclusive. Human lands welcome large 
numbers of nonhumans compared to the proportion of 
humans who live in nonhuman lands. 


EXEMPLARS OF AMBITION 


Humans who seek adventure are the most daring and 
ambitious members of a daring and ambitious race. They 
seek to earn glory in the eyes of their fellows by amassing 
power, wealth, and fame. More than other people, hu- 
mans champion causes rather than territories or groups. 


HuMAN NAMES AND ETHNICITIES 


Having so much more variety than other cultures, hu- 
mans as a whole have no typical names. Some human 
parents give their children names from other languages, 
such as Dwarvish or Elvish (pronounced more or less 
correctly), but most parents give names that are linked to 
their region’s culture or to the naming traditions of their 
ancestors. 

The material culture and physical characteristics of 
humans can change wildly from region to region. In 
the Forgotten Realms, for example, the clothing, archi- 
tecture, cuisine, music, and literature are different in 
the northwestern lands of the Silver Marches than in 
distant Turmish or Impiltur to the east—and even more 
distinctive in far-off Kara-Tur. Human physical character- 
istics, though, vary according to the ancient migrations 
of the earliest humans, so that the humans of the Silver 
Marches have every possible variation of coloration 
and features. 

In the Forgotten Realms, nine human ethnic groups 
are widely recognized, though over a dozen others are 


Nass 
EVERYONE’S SECOND-BEST FRIENDS 
Just as readily as they mix with each other, humans mingle 
with members of other races. They get along with almost 
everyone, though they might not be close to many. Humans 
serve as ambassadors, diplomats, magistrates, merchants, 
and functionaries of all kinds. 
Dwarves. “They’re stout folk, stalwart friends, and true to 
their word. Their greed for gold is their downfall, though.” 
Elves. “\t’s best not to wander into elven woods. They 
don’t like intruders, and you'll as likely be bewitched as 
peppered with arrows. Still, if an elf can get past that 
damned racial pride and actually treat you like an equal, you 
can learn a lot from them.” 
Halflings. “It’s hard to beat a meal in a halfling home, 
as long as you don’t crack your head on the ceiling—good 
food and good stories in front of a nice, warm fire. If 
halflings had a shred of ambition, they might really amount 
to something.” 
REE eee rere 


found in more localized areas of Faerfin. These groups, 
and the typical names of their members, can be used as 
inspiration no matter which world your human is in. 


CALISHITE 

Shorter and slighter in build than most other humans, 
Calishites have dusky brown skin, hair, and eyes. They’re 
found primarily in southwest Faerfin.

Mostana, Pashar, Rein 


CHONDATHAN 

Chondathans are slender, tawny-skinned folk with brown 
hair that ranges from almost blond to almost black. 

Most are tall and have green or brown eyes, but these 
traits are hardly universal. Humans of Chondathan 
descent dominate the central lands of Faeriin, around 
the Inner Sea. 


Chondathan Names: (Male) Darvin, Dorn, Evendur, 
Gorstag, Grim, Helm, Malark, Morn, Randal, Stedd; 
(female) Arveene, Esvele, Jhessail, Kerri, Lureene, Miri,

Buckman, Dundragon, Evenwood, Greycastle, Tallstag 


DAMARAN 

Found primarily in the northwest of Faerin, Damarans 
are of moderate height and build, with skin hues ranging 
from tawny to fair. Their hair is usually brown or black, 
and their eye color varies widely, though brown is 

most common. 


Damaran Names: (Male) Bor, Fodel, Glar, Grigor, Igan, 
Ivor, Kosef, Mival, Orel, Pavel, Sergor; (female) Alethra, 
Kara, Katernin, Mara, Natali, Olma, Tana, Zora;

MULAN 

Dominant in the eastern and southeastern shores of the 
Inner Sea, the Mulan are generally tall, slim, and amber- 
skinned, with eyes of hazel or brown. Their hair ranges 
from black to dark brown, but in the lands where the 
Mulan are most prominent, nobles and many other Mulan 
shave off all their hair. 


Mulan Names: (Male) Aoth, Bareris, Ehput-Ki, Kethoth,

TETHYRIAN 

Widespread along the entire Sword Coast at the west- 
ern edge of Faerdin, Tethyrians are of medium build 
and height, with dusky skin that tends to grow fairer the 
farther north they dwell. Their hair and eye color varies 
widely, but brown hair and blue eyes are the most com- 
mon. Tethyrians primarily use Chondathan names. 


TURAMI 

Native to the southern shore of the Inner Sea, the 
Turami people are generally tall and muscular, with dark 
mahogany skin, curly black hair, and dark eyes. 


Turami Names: (Male) Anton, Diero, Marcon, Pieron, 
Rimardo, Romero, Salazar, Umbero; (female) Balama,

HUMAN TRAITS 


It’s hard to make generalizations about humans, but your 
human character has these traits. 

Ability Score Increase. Your ability scores each in- 
crease by 1. 

Age. Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and 
live less than a century. 

Alignment. Humans tend toward no particular align- 
ment. The best and the worst are found among them. 

Size. Humans vary widely in height and build, from 
barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your 
position in that range, your size is Medium. 

Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. 
Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common 
and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically 

learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, 
including obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling 
their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: 
Orc curses, Elvish musical expressions, Dwarvish mili- 
tary phrases, and so on.

CHAPTER 3: CLASSES 


ADVENTURERS ARE EXTRAORDINARY PEOPLE, DRIVEN BY 
a thirst for excitement into a life that others would never 
dare lead. They are heroes, compelled to explore the dark 
places of the world and take on the challenges that lesser 
women and men can’t stand against. 

Class is the primary definition of what your character 
can do. It’s more than a profession; it’s your character’s 
calling. Class shapes the way you think about the world 
and interact with it and your relationship with other peo- 
ple and powers in the multiverse. A fighter, for example, 
might view the world in pragmatic terms of strategy and 
maneuvering, and see herself as just a pawn in a much 
larger game. A cleric, by contrast, might see himself as 
a willing servant in a god’s unfolding plan or a conflict 
brewing among various deities. While the fighter has con- 
tacts in a mercenary company or army, the cleric might 
know a number of priests, paladins, and devotees who 
share his faith. 

Your class gives you a variety of special features, 
such as a fighter’s mastery of weapons and armor, and 
a wizard’s spells. At low levels, your class gives you 
only two or three features, but as you advance in level 
you gain more and your existing features often im- 
prove. Each class entry in this chapter includes a table 
summarizing the benefits you gain at every level, and 
a detailed explanation of each one. 

Adventurers sometimes advance in more than one 
class. A rogue might switch direction in life and dab- 
ble in the cleric class while continuing to advance as a 
rogue. Elves are known to combine martial mastery with 
magical training and advance as fighters and wizards 
simultaneously. Optional rules for combining classes in 
this way, called multiclassing, can be found in the Play- 
er’s Handbook. 

Four basic classes—listed in the Classes table—are 
found in almost every D&amp;D world and define most typical 
adventurers. See the Player's Handbook for information 
about other classes.

CLERIC 


Arms and eyes upraised toward the sun and a prayer 
on his lips, an elf begins to glow with an inner light that 
spills out to heal his battle-worn companions. 

Chanting a song of glory, a dwarf swings his axe in 
wide swaths to cut through the ranks of orcs arrayed 
against him, shouting praise to the gods with every 
foe’s fall. 

Calling down a curse upon the forces of undeath, a 
human lifts her holy symbol as light pours from it to drive 
back the zombies crowding in on her companions. 

Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world 
and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods 
they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of 
their deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with 
divine magic. 


HEALERS AND WARRIORS 


Divine magic, as the name suggests, is the power of the 
gods, flowing from them into the world. Clerics are con- 
duits for that power, manifesting it as miraculous effects. 
The gods don’t grant this power to everyone who seeks it, 
but only to those chosen to fulfill a high calling. 

Harnessing divine magic doesn’t rely on study or train- 
ing. A cleric might learn formulaic prayers and ancient 
rites, but the ability to cast cleric spells relies on devotion 
and an intuitive sense of a deity’s wishes. 

Clerics combine the helpful magic of healing and in- 
spiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder foes. 
They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of plague 
or poison, and even call down flames from heaven to con- 
sume their enemies. For those evildoers who will benefit 
most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on their 
combat training to let them wade into melee with the 
power of the gods on their side. 


DIVINE AGENTS 


Not every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine isa 
cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple 
service, carrying out their gods’ will through prayer and

CHAPTER 3: CLASSES 














sacrifice, not by magic and strength of arms. In some cit- 
ies, priesthood amounts to a political office, viewed as a 
stepping stone to higher positions of authority and involv- 
ing no communion with a god at all. True clerics are rare 
in most hierarchies. 

When a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually 
because his or her god demands it. Pursuing the goals 
of the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the 
walls of civilization, smiting evil or seeking holy relics in 
ancient tombs. Many clerics are also expected to protect 
their deities’ worshipers, which can mean fighting ram- 
paging orcs, negotiating peace between warring nations, 
or sealing a portal that would allow a demon prince to 
enter the world. 

Most adventuring clerics maintain some connection to 
established temples and orders of their faiths. A temple 
might ask for a cleric’s aid, or a high priest might be ina 
position to demand it. 


CREATING A CLERIC 


As you create a cleric, the most important question to 
consider is which deity to serve and what principles you 
want your character to embody. The Player’s Handbook 
includes lists of many of the gods of the multiverse. 
Check with your DM to learn which deities are in 

your campaign. 

Once you’ve chosen a deity, consider your cleric’s rela- 
tionship to that god. Did you enter this service willingly? 
Or did the god choose you, impelling you into service 
with no regard for your wishes? How do the temple 
priests of your faith regard you: as a champion or a trou- 
blemaker? What are your ultimate goals? Does your deity

SPELLCASTING 


As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells. 
See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and 
chapter 11 for a selection of cleric spells. 


CANTRIPS 

At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from 
the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips 
of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips 
Known column of the Cleric table. 


PREPARING AND CASTING SPELLS 

The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to 
cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one 
of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level 
or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you 
finish a long rest. 

You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for 
you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you 
do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wis- 
dom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). 
The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. 

For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 
1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 
16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 
1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 
1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st- 
level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it 
from your list of prepared spells. 

You can change your list of prepared spells when you 
finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells 
requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 
minute per spell level for each spell on your list. 


SPELLCASTING ABILITY 

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. 
The power of your spells comes from your devotion to 
your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell 
refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use 
your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw 
DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack 
roll with one. 


Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + 
your Wisdom modifier 


Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + 
your Wisdom modifier 


RITUAL CASTING 
You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the 
ritual tag and you have the spell prepared. 


SPELLCASTING Focus 
You can use a holy symbol (found in chapter 5) as a spell- 
casting focus for your cleric spells. 


DIVINE DOMAIN 


Choose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge, 
Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. The Life 
domain is detailed at the end of the class description and 
provides examples of gods associated with it. See the 
Player’s Handbook for details on all the domains. 

Your choice grants you domain spells and other fea- 
tures when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you 
additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain 
that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 
8th, and 17th levels. 


DOMAIN SPELLS 
Each domain has a list of spells—its domain spells—that 
you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain descrip- 
tion. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it 
prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of 
spells you can prepare each day. 

If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the 
cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you. 


CHANNEL DIVINITY 


At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy 
directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical 
effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and 
an effect determined by your domain. Some domains 
grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as 
noted in the domain description. 

When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which 
effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest 
to use your Channel Divinity again. 

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. 
When you use such an effect from this class, the DC 
equals your cleric spell save DC. 

Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divin- 
ity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you 
can use it three times between rests. When you finish a 
short or long rest, you regain your expended uses. 


CHANNEL DIVINITY: TURN UNDEAD 

As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a 
prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see 
or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom 
saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is 
turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. 

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move 
as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move 
to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reac- 
tions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or 
try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. 
If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the 
Dodge action. 


ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT 


When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, 
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your 
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your 
choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score 
above 20 using this feature.

DESTROY UNDEAD 


Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving 
throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is 
instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a 
certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table. 


DESTROY UNDEAD 


Cleric Level Destroys Undead of CR... 
5th 1/2 or lower 
8th 1 or lower 
With 2 or lower 
14th 3 or lower 
17th 4 or lower 


DIVINE INTERVENTION 


Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to in- 
tervene on your behalf when your need is great. 

Imploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your ac- 
tion. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile 
dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your 
cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the 
nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or 
cleric domain spell would be appropriate. 

If your deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature again 
for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you fin- 
ish a long rest. 

At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds auto- 
matically, no roll required. 


DIVINE DOMAINS 


In a pantheon, every deity has influence over different 
aspects of mortal life and civilization, called a deity’s 
domain. All the domains over which a deity has influence 
are called the deity’s portfolio. For example, the port- 
folio of the Greek god Apollo includes the domains of 
Knowledge, Life, and Light. As a cleric, you choose one 
aspect of your deity’s portfolio to emphasize, and you are 
granted powers related to that domain. 

Your choice might correspond to a particular sect 
dedicated to your deity. Apollo, for example, could be 
worshiped in one region as Phoebus (“radiant”) Apollo, 
emphasizing his influence over the Light domain, and in 
a different place as Apollo Acesius (“healing”), emphasiz- 
ing his association with the Life domain. Alternatively, 
your choice of domain could simply be a matter of per- 
sonal preference, the aspect of the deity that appeals 
to you most. 

Each domain’s description gives examples of deities 
who have influence over that domain. Gods are included 
from the worlds of the Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, 
Dragonlance, and Eberron campaign settings, as well as 
from the Celtic, Greek, Norse, and Egyptian pantheons of 
antiquity. 


LIFE DOMAIN 


The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive en- 
ergy—one of the fundamental forces of the universe—that 
sustains all life. The gods of life promote vitality and 
health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for 


those in need, and driving away the forces of death and 
undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim influence 
over this domain, particularly agricultural deities (such 
as Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun gods (such as 
Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of healing 

or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and 
Diancecht), and gods of home and community (such as 
Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei). 


LiFE DOMAIN SPELLS 


Cleric Level Spells 
Ist bless, cure wounds 
3rd lesser restoration, spiritual weapon 
5th beacon of hope, revivify 
7th death ward, guardian of faith 
9th mass cure wounds, raise dead 


BONUS PROFICIENCY 
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain profi- 
ciency with heavy armor. 


DISCIPLE OF LIFE 

Also starting at 1st level, your healing spells are more 
effective. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher 
to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains 
additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s level. 


CHANNEL DIVINITY: PRESERVE LIFE 
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity 
to heal the badly injured. 

As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke 
healing energy that can restore a number of hit points 
equal to five times your cleric level. Choose any creatures 
within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among 
them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than 
half of its hit point maximum. You can’t use this feature 
on an undead or a construct. 


BLESSED HEALER 

Beginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on 
others heal you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level 
or higher that restores hit points to a creature other than 
you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s level. 


DIVINE STRIKE 

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon 
strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns 
when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can 
cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to 
the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage 
increases to 2d8. 


SUPREME HEALING 

Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one 
or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead 
use the highest number possible for each die. For exam- 
ple, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you 
restore 12.

FIGHTER 


A human in clanging plate armor holds her shield before 
her as she runs toward the massed goblins. An elf behind 
her, clad in studded leather armor, peppers the goblins 
with arrows loosed from his exquisite bow. The half-orc 
nearby shouts orders, helping the two combatants coordi- 
nate their assault to the best advantage. 

A dwarf in chain mail interposes his shield between the 
ogre’s club and his companion, knocking the deadly blow 
aside. His companion, a half-elf in scale armor, swings 
two scimitars in a blinding whirl as she circles the ogre, 
looking for a blind spot in its defenses. 

A gladiator fights for sport in an arena, a master with 
his trident and net, skilled at toppling foes and moving 
them around for the crowd’s delight—and his own tactical 
advantage. His opponent’s sword flares with blue light 
an instant before she sends lightning flashing forth to 
smite him. 

All of these heroes are fighters, perhaps the most di- 
verse class of characters in the worlds of DUNGEONS &amp; 
DRAGONS. Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal 
champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries, 
and bandit kings—as fighters, they all share an unparal- 
leled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough 
knowledge of the skills of combat. And they are well 
acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it 
defiantly in the face. 


WELL-ROUNDED SPECIALISTS 


Fighters learn the basics of all combat styles. Every 
fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a 
longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes 
in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a fighter 

is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond 
that basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes 
in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on ar- 
chery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and 
some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. 
This combination of broad general ability and exten- 
sive specialization makes fighters superior combatants 
on battlefields and in dungeons alike. 


‘TRAINED FOR DANGER 


Not every member of the city watch, the village militia, 
or the queen’s army is a fighter. Most of these troops are 
relatively untrained soldiers with only the most basic 
combat knowledge. Veteran soldiers, military officers, 
trained bodyguards, dedicated knights, and similar fig- 
ures are fighters. 

Some fighters feel drawn to use their training as adven- 
turers. The dungeon delving, monster slaying, and other 
dangerous work common among adventurers is second 
nature for a fighter, not all that different from the life he 
or she left behind. There are greater risks, perhaps, but 
also much greater rewards—few fighters in the city watch 
have the opportunity to discover a magic flame tongue 
sword, for example. 


CREATING A FIGHTER 


As you build your fighter, think about two related ele- 
ments of your character’s background: Where did you get 
your combat training, and what set you apart from the 
mundane warriors around you? Were you particularly 
ruthless? Did you get extra help from a mentor, perhaps 
because of your exceptional dedication? What drove you 
to this training in the first place? A threat to your home- 
land, a thirst for revenge, or a need to prove yourself 
might all have been factors. 

You might have enjoyed formal training in a noble’s 
army or in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war 
academy, learning strategy, tactics, and military history. 
Or you might be self-taught—unpolished but well tested. 
Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits 
of life on a farm, or are you following a proud family tra- 
dition? Where did you acquire your weapons and armor? 
They might have been military issue or family heirlooms, 
or perhaps you scrimped and saved for years to buy them. 
Your armaments are now among your most important 
possessions—the only things that stand between you and 
death’s embrace. 


Quick BUILD 

You can make a fighter quickly by following these sug- 
gestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest 
ability score, depending on whether you want to focus 
on melee weapons or on archery (or finesse weapons). 
Your next-highest score should be Constitution. Second, 
choose the soldier background.

GREAT WEAPON FIGHTING 

When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you 
make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with 
two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new 
roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must 
have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain

starting at 13th level and three times between long rests 
starting at 17th level.

RICHARD WHITTERS 


MARTIAL ARCHETYPES 


Different fighters choose different approaches to perfect- 
ing their fighting prowess. The martial archetype you 
choose to emulate reflects your approach. 


CHAMPION 


The archetypal Champion focuses on the development 
of raw physical power honed to deadly perfection. 
Those who model themselves on this archetype combine 
rigorous training with physical excellence to deal devas- 
tating blows. 


IMPROVED CRITICAL 
Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd 


level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit ona roll 
of 19 or 20. 


REMARKABLE ATHLETE 
Starting at 7th level, you can add half your proficiency 
bonus (round up) to any Strength, Dexterity, or Con- 
stitution check you make that doesn’t already use your 
proficiency bonus. 

In addition, when you make a running long jump, the 
distance you can cover increases by a number of feet 
equal to your Strength modifier. 


ADDITIONAL FIGHTING STYLE 
At 10th level, you can choose a second option from the 
Fighting Style class feature. 


SUPERIOR CRITICAL 


Starting at 15th level, your weapon attacks score a criti- 
cal hit on a roll of 18-20. 


SURVIVOR 

At 18th level, you attain the pinnacle of resilience in bat- 
tle. At the start of each of your turns, you regain hit points 
equal to 5 + your Constitution modifier if you have no 
more than half of your hit points left. You don’t gain this 
benefit if you have 0 hit points. 





ROGUE 


Signaling for her companions to wait, a halfling creeps 
forward through the dungeon hall. She presses an ear 
to the door, then pulls out a set of tools and picks the 
lock in the blink of an eye. Then she disappears into the 
shadows as her fighter friend moves forward to kick the 
door open. 

A human lurks in the shadows of an alley while his 
accomplice prepares for her part in the ambush. When 
their target—a notorious slaver—passes the alleyway, 
the accomplice cries out, the slaver comes to investigate, 
and the assassin’s blade cuts his throat before he can 
make a sound. 

Suppressing a giggle, a gnome waggles her fingers and 
magically lifts the key ring from the guard’s belt. In a mo- 
ment, the keys are in her hand, the cell door is open, and 
she and her companions are free to make their escape. 

Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes’ vulnerabil- 
ities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a 
knack for finding the solution to just about any problem, 
demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is 
the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party. 


SKILL AND PRECISION 


Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of 

a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat 
abilities, giving them a broad expertise that few other 
characters can match. Many rogues focus on stealth and 
deception, while others refine the skills that help them 
in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and 
disarming traps, and opening locks. 

When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning 
over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one 
precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will 
hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down with a 
barrage of attacks. Rogues have an almost supernatural 
knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn magical tricks 
to supplement their other abilities. 


A SHADY LIVING 


Every town and city has its share of rogues. Most of them 
live up to the worst stereotypes of the class, making a 
living as burglars, assassins, cutpurses, and con art- 

ists. Often, these scoundrels are organized into thieves’ 
guilds or crime families. Plenty of rogues operate inde- 
pendently, but even they sometimes recruit apprentices to 
help them in their scams and heists. A few rogues make 
an honest living as locksmiths, investigators, or extermi- 
nators, which can be a dangerous job in a world where 
dire rats—and wererats—haunt the sewers. 

As adventurers, rogues fall on both sides of the law. 
Some are hardened criminals who decide to seek their 
fortune in treasure hoards, while others take up a life of 
adventure to escape from the law. Some have learned 
and perfected their skills with the explicit purpose of 
infiltrating ancient ruins and hidden crypts in search 
of treasure. 


CREATING A ROGUE 


As you create your rogue character, consider the char- 
acter’s relationship to the law. Do you have a criminal 


CHAPTER 3: CLASSES 








D&amp;D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only 





past—or present? Are you on the run from the law or 
from an angry thieves’ guild master? Or did you leave 
your guild in search of bigger risks and bigger rewards? 
Is it greed that drives you in your adventures, or some 
other desire or ideal? 

What was the trigger that led you away from your pre- 
vious life? Did a great con or heist gone terribly wrong 
cause you to reevaluate your career? Maybe you were 
lucky and a successful robbery gave you the coin you 
needed to escape the squalor of your life. Did wander- 
lust finally call you away from your home? Perhaps you 
suddenly found yourself cut off from your family or your 
mentor, and you had to find a new means of support. Or 
maybe you made a new friend—another member of your 
adventuring party—who showed you new possibilities for 
earning a living and employing your particular talents. 


Quick BUILD 

You can make a rogue quickly by following these sug- 
gestions. First, Dexterity should be your highest ability 
score. Make Intelligence your next-highest if you want to 
excel at Investigation. Choose Charisma instead if you 
plan to emphasize deception and social interaction. Sec- 
ond, choose the criminal background. 


CLASS FEATURES 


As a rogue, you have the following class features. 


HiT PoINnTs

At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficien- 
cies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain this benefit. 


SNEAK ATTACK 


Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and 
exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an 
extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack 
if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must 
use a finesse or a ranged weapon. 

You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another 
enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t 
incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the 
attack roll. 

The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain 
levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column 
of the Rogue table. 


THIEVES’ CANT 


During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a 
secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to 
hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only 
another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands 
such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such 
a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly. 

In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and 
symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as 
whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ 
guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in 
an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for 
thieves on the run. 


CHAPTER 3: CLASSES

CUNNING ACTION 


Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility 
allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus 
action on each of your turns in combat. This action can 
be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action. 


ROGUISH ARCHETYPE 


At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in 


the exercise of your rogue abilities. The Thief archetype 
is detailed here; see the Player’s Handbook for other ar- 
chetypes. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and 
then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level. 


ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT 


When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 


16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of 
your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of 
your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability 

score above 20 using this feature. 


UNCANNY DODGE 


Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see 


hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve 
the attack’s damage against you. 


EVASION 


Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the 


way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery 
breath or an ice storm spell. When you are subjected 

to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving 
throw to take only half damage, you instead take no 
damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half 
damage if you fail. 


RELIABLE TALENT 


By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until 
they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability 
check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can 
treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower asa 10. 


BLINDSENSE 


Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are 
aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature 
within 10 feet of you. 


SLIPPERY MIND 

By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. 
You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. 
ELUSIVE 


Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers 
rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has 
advantage against you while you aren't incapacitated. 


STROKE OF LUCK 


At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding 
when you need to. If your attack misses a target within 
range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if 
you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20. 

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until 
you finish a short or long rest. 


ROGUISH ARCHETYPES 


Rogues have many features in common, including their 
emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and 
deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick 
reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in vary- 
ing directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your 
choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus—not 
necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a 
description of your preferred techniques. 


THIEF 


You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, 
bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow 
this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of 
themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, 
delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your 
agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into 
ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using 
magic items you normally couldn’t employ. 


FAST HANDS 

Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action 
granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity 
(Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves’ tools to disarm 
a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action. 


SECOND-STORY WORK 
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the 
ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer 
costs you extra movement. 

In addition, when you make a running jump, the dis- 
tance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to 
your Dexterity modifier. 


SUPREME SNEAK 

Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity 
(Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed 
on the same turn. 


UsE Macic DEVICE 

By 13th level, you have learned enough about the work- 
ings of magic that you can improvise the use of items 
even when they are not intended for you. You ignore 

all class, race, and level requirements on the use of 
magic items. 


THIEF’S REFLEXES 

When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at lay- 
ing ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take 
two turns during the first round of any combat. You take 
your first turn at your normal initiative and your second 
turn at your initiative minus 10. You can’t use this feature 
when you are surprised.

WIZARD 


Clad in the silver robes that denote her station, an elf 
closes her eyes to shut out the distractions of the battle- 
field and begins her quiet chant. Fingers weaving in front 
of her, she completes her spell and launches a tiny bead 
of fire toward the enemy ranks, where it erupts into a con- 
flagration that engulfs the soldiers. 

Checking and rechecking his work, a human scribes 
an intricate magic circle in chalk on the bare stone 
floor, then sprinkles powdered iron along every line and 
graceful curve. When the circle is complete, he drones 
a long incantation. A hole opens in space inside the cir- 
cle, bringing a whiff of brimstone from the otherworldly 
plane beyond. 

Crouching on the floor in a dungeon intersection, a 
gnome tosses a handful of small bones inscribed with 
mystic symbols, muttering a few words of power over 
them. Closing his eyes to see the visions more clearly, 
he nods slowly, then opens his eyes and points down the 
passage to his left. 

Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united 
as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle 
weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast 
spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, 
and brute-force mind control. Their magic conjures mon- 
sters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, 
or turns slain foes into zombies. Their mightiest spells 
change one substance into another, call meteors down 
from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.

SCHOLARS OF THE ARCANE 


Wild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the 
power of magic draws students who seek to master its 
mysteries. Some aspire to become like the gods, shap- 
ing reality itself. Though the casting of a typical spell 
requires merely the utterance of a few strange words, 
fleeting gestures, and sometimes a pinch or clump of 
exotic materials, these surface components barely hint at 
the expertise attained after years of apprenticeship and 
countless hours of study. 

Wizards live and die by their spells. Everything else is 
secondary. They learn new spells as they experiment and 
grow in experience. They can also learn them from other 
wizards, from ancient tomes or inscriptions, and from an- 
cient creatures (Such as the fey) that are steeped in magic. 


THE LURE OF KNOWLEDGE 


Wizards’ lives are seldom mundane. The closest a wizard 
is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage 
or lecturer in a library or university, teaching others the 
secrets of the multiverse. Other wizards sell their ser- 
vices as diviners, serve in military forces, or pursue lives 
of crime or domination. 

But the lure of knowledge and power calls even the 
most unadventurous wizards out of the safety of their 
libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and 
lost cities. Most wizards believe that their counterparts 
in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have 
been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could 
unlock the path to a power greater than any magic avail- 
able in the present age.

CREATING A WIZARD 


Creating a wizard character demands a backstory dom- 


inated by at least one extraordinary event. How did your 
character first come into contact with magic? How did 
you discover you had an aptitude for it? Do you have a 
natural talent, or did you simply study hard and practice 
incessantly? Did you encounter a magical creature or an 
ancient tome that taught you the basics of magic? 

What drew you forth from your life of study? Did your 
first taste of magical knowledge leave you hungry for 
more? Have you received word of a secret repository of 
knowledge not yet plundered by any other wizard? Per- 
haps you're simply eager to put your newfound magical 
skills to the test in the face of danger. 


Quick BUILD 

You can make a wizard quickly by following these sug- 
gestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability 
score, followed by Constitution or Dexterity. Second, 
choose the sage background. Third, choose the /ight, 
mage hand, and ray of frost cantrips, along with the 
following 1st-level spells for your spellbook: burning 
hands, charm person, mage armor, magic missile, shield, 
and sleep. 


CLASS FEATURES 


As a wizard, you gain the following class features. 


HiT POINnTs

¢ Aspellbook 


SPELLCASTING 


As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook con- 
taining spells that show the first glimmerings of your true 
power. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcast- 
ing and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list. 


CANTRIPS 

At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from 
the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips 
of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips 
Known column of the Wizard table. 


SPELLBOOK 

At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level 
wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repos- 
itory of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, 
which are fixed in your mind. 


PREPARING AND CASTING SPELLS 

The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have 
to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast 
one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s 
level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when 
you finish a long rest. 

You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available 
for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells 
from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + 
your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must 
be of a level for which you have spell slots. 

For example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have 
four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an In- 
telligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include 
six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen 
from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell 
magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd- 
level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your 
list of prepared spells. 

You can change your list of prepared spells when you 
finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells 
requires time spent studying your spellbook and mem- 
orizing the incantations and gestures you must make to 
cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each 
spell on your list. 


SPELLCASTING ABILITY 

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard 
spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated 
study and memorization. You use your Intelligence 
whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In 
addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting 
the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when 
making an attack roll with one. 


Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + 
your Intelligence modifier 


Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + 
your Intelligence modifier 


RITUAL CASTING 

You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the 
ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You 
don’t need to have the spell prepared. 


SPELLCASTING Focus 
You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a 
spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

LEARNING SPELLS OF IST LEVEL AND HIGHER 
Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wiz- 
ard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each 
of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell 
slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, 
you might find other spells that you can add to your spell- 
book (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar). 


ARCANE RECOVERY 


You have learned to regain some of your magical energy 
by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you fin- 
ish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to 
recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is 
equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), 
and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. 

For example, if you're a 4th-level wizard, you can recover 
up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 
2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots. 


SS &gt;&gt;—_NlbhHHR"~A~EH_—_SpD_—ELLnDD»&gt;_—————— IEEE 
YOuR SPELLBOOK 


The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels 
reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well 
as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature 
of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your 
adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll 
in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in 
an ancient library. 

Copying a Spell into the Book. When you find a wizard 
spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook 
if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare 
the time to decipher and copy it. 

Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing 
the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique 
system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You 
must practice the spell until you understand the sounds 
or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook 
using your own notation. 

For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and 
costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you 
expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well 
as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent 
this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your 
other spells. 

Replacing the Book. You can copy a spell from your own 
spellbook into another book—for example, if you want 
to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like 
copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and 
easier, since you understand your own notation and already 
know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 
10 gp for each level of the copied spell. 

If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same 
procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared 
into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your 
spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as 
normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup 
spellbooks in a safe place. 

The Book’s Appearance. Your spellbook is a unique 
compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and 
margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume 
that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound 
gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a 
loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost 
your previous spellbook in a mishap.

ARCANE TRADITION 


When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradi- 
tion, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight 
schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchant- 
ment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation. 
The school of Evocation is detailed at the end of the class 
description; see the Player’s Handbook for information 
on the other schools. 

Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again 
at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. 


ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT 


When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, 
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your 
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your 
choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score 
above 20 using this feature. 


SPELL MASTERY 


At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over 
certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 
1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that 
are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their 
lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have 
them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher 
level, you must expend a spell slot as normal. 

By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one 
or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the 
same levels. 


SIGNATURE SPELLS 


When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two 
powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. 
Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as 
your signature spells. You always have these spells pre- 
pared, they don’t count against the number of spells you 
have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd 
level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you 
can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest. 

If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you 
must expend a spell slot as normal. 


ARCANE TRADITIONS 


The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the 
earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly estab- 
lished in the worlds of D&amp;D, with various traditions 
dedicated to its complex study. 

The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse 
revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through 
the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping 
them into eight categories called schools, as described 
in chapter 10. In some places, these traditions are lit- 
erally schools. Elsewhere, they are more like academic 
departments, with rival faculties competing for students 
and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the 
solitude of their own towers use the division of magic 
into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each 
school require mastery of different techniques.

RICHARD WHITTERS 


SCHOOL OF EVOCATION 


You focus your study on magic that creates powerful ele- 


mental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling 
thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some 
evokers find employment in military forces, serving as 
artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use 
their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some 
seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspir- 
ing tyrants. 


EVOCATION SAVANT 

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the 
gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell 
into your spellbook is halved. 


SCULPT SPELLS 


Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative 


safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When 
you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures 


that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal 


to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automati- 
cally succeed on their saving throws against the spell, 


and they take no damage if they would normally take half 


damage on a successful save. 


POTENT CANTRIP 

Starting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even 
creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a crea- 
ture succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, 
the creature takes half the cantrip’s damage (if any) but 
suffers no additional effect from the cantrip. 


EMPOWERED EVOCATION 
Beginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence 
modifier to one damage roll of any wizard evocation 

spell you cast. 


OvVERCHANNEL 

Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of 
your simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st 
through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maxi- 
mum damage with that spell. 

The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If 
you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, 
you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, 
immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this 
feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic 
damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage 
ignores resistance and immunity.

CHAPTER 4: PERSONALITY AND BACKGROUND 


CHARACTERS ARE DEFINED BY MUCH MORE THAN THEIR 
race and class. They’re individuals with their own stories, 
interests, connections, and capabilities beyond those 

that class and race define. This chapter expounds on the 
details that distinguish characters from one another, in- 
cluding the basics of name and physical description, the 
rules of backgrounds and languages, and the finer points 
of personality and alignment. 


CHARACTER DETAILS 


Your character’s name and physical description might be 
the first things that the other players at the table learn 
about you. It’s worth thinking about how these character- 
istics reflect the character you have in mind. 


NAME 


Your character’s race description includes sample names 
for members of that race. Put some thought into your 
name even if you’re just picking one from a list. 


SEX 


You can play a male or female character without gaining 
any special benefits or hindrances. Think about how your 
character does or does not conform to the broader cul- 
ture’s expectations of sex, gender, and sexual behavior. 
For example, a male drow cleric defies the traditional 
gender divisions of drow society, which could be a rea- 
son for your character to leave that society and come to 
the surface. 
peewee 

TIKA AND ARTEMIS: CONTRASTING CHARACTERS 

The details in this chapter make a big difference in setting 

your character apart from every other character. Consider 

the following two human fighters. 

Hailing from the Dragonlance setting, Tika Waylan was a 
brash teenager who had a rough childhood. The daughter of 
a thief, she ran away from home and practiced her father’s 
trade on the streets of Solace. When she tried to rob the 
proprietor of the Inn of the Last Home, he caught her and 
took her under his wing, giving her a job as a barmaid. But 
when the dragonarmies laid waste to the town of Solace 
and destroyed the inn, necessity forced Tika into adventure 
alongside the friends she’d known from her childhood. Her 
skill as a fighter (a frying pan remains one of her favorite 
weapons) combined with her history on the streets gave her 
skills invaluable in her adventuring career. 

Artemis Entreri grew up on the streets of Calimport in the 
Forgotten Realms. He used his wits, strength, and agility 
to carve out his own territory in one of the city’s hundreds 
of poor shanty towns. After several years, he attracted the 
notice of one of the most powerful thieves’ guilds in the 
city, and he ascended the ranks of the guild quickly despite 
his youth. Artemis became the favored assassin of one 
of the city’s pashas, who sent him to far-off Icewind Dale 
to recover some stolen gems. He’s a professional killer, 
constantly challenging himself to improve his skills. 

Tika and Artemis are both human and both fighters (with 
some experience as rogues), possessing similarly high 
Strength and Dexterity scores, but there the similarity ends. 

SSS 


D&amp;D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and ¢ 


You don’t need to be confined to binary notions of sex 
and gender. The elf god Corellon Larethian is often seen 
as androgynous, for example, and some elves in the mul- 
tiverse are made in Corellon’s image. You could also play 
a female character who presents herself as a man, a man 
who feels trapped in a female body, or a bearded female 
dwarf who hates being mistaken for a male. Likewise, 
your character’s sexual orientation is for you to decide. 


HEIGHT AND WEIGHT 


You can decide your character’s height and weight, using 
the information provided in your race description or on 
the Random Height and Weight table. Think about what 
your character’s ability scores might say about his or 

her height and weight. A weak but agile character might 
be thin. A strong and tough character might be tall or 
just heavy. 

If you want to, you can roll randomly for your charac- 
ter’s height and weight using the Random Height and 
Weight table. The dice roll given in the Height Modifier 
column determines the character’s extra height (in 
inches) beyond the base height. That same number mul- 
tiplied by the dice roll or quantity given in the Weight 
Modifier column determines the character’s extra weight 
(in pounds) beyond the base weight. 


RANDOM HEIGHT AND WEIGHT 


Base Height Base Weight 

Race Height Modifier Weight Modifier 
Human 4'8" +2d10 110 lb. x (2d4) Ib. 
Dwarf, hill 3'8" +2d4 115lb. x (2d6) Ib. 
Dwarf, mountain 4' +2d4 130 1b. x (2d6) Ib. 
Elf, high 4'6" +2d10 90 |b. x (1d4) Ib 
EIf, wood 46" +2d10 ~=—-100 lb._— x (14) Ib. 
Halfling 2'7" +2d4 35 Ib. x 1 Ib. 


For example, as a human, Tika has a height of 4 feet 8 
inches plus 2d10 inches. Her player rolls 2d10 and gets 
a total of 12, so Tika stands 5 feet 8 inches tall. Then the 
player uses that same roll of 12 and multiplies it by 2d4 
pounds. Her 2d4 roll is 3, so Tika weighs an extra 36 
pounds (12 x 3) on top of her base 110 pounds, for a total 
of 146 pounds. 


OTHER PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS 


You choose your character’s age and the color of his or 
her hair, eyes, and skin. To add a touch of distinctiveness, 
you might want to give your character an unusual or 
memorable physical characteristic, such as a scar, a limp, 
or a tattoo. 


ALIGNMENT 


A typical creature in the worlds of DUNGEONS &amp; DRAG- 
ONS has an alignment, which broadly describes its moral 
and personal attitudes. Alignment is a combination of 
two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), 
and the other describes attitudes toward society and 


CHAPTER 4: PERSONALITY AND BACKGROUND 
- a —_ 35 





nis document for personal use only 





order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct 
alignments define the possible combinations. 

These brief summaries of the nine alignments describe 
the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment. 
Individuals might vary significantly from that typical 
behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently 
faithful to the precepts of their alignment. 

Lawful good (LG) creatures can be counted on to do 
the right thing as expected by society. Gold dragons, pala- 
dins, and most dwarves are lawful good. 

Neutral good (NG) folk do the best they can to help oth- 
ers according to their needs. Many celestials, some cloud 
giants, and most gnomes are neutral good. 

Chaotic good (CG) creatures act as their conscience 
directs, with little regard for what others expect. Copper 
dragons, many elves, and unicorns are chaotic good. 

Lawful neutral (LN) individuals act in accordance with 
law, tradition, or personal codes. Many monks and some 
wizards are lawful neutral. 

Neutral (N) is the alignment of those who prefer to 
steer clear of moral questions and don’t take sides, doing 
what seems best at the time. Lizardfolk, most druids, and 
many humans are neutral. 

Chaotic neutral (CN) creatures follow their whims, 
holding their personal freedom above all else. Many bar- 
barians and rogues, and some bards, are chaotic neutral. 

Lawful evil (LE) creatures methodically take what they 
want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or or- 
der. Devils, blue dragons, and hobgoblins are lawful evil. 

Neutral evil (NE) is the alignment of those who do 
whatever they can get away with, without compassion or 
qualms. Many drow, some cloud giants, and yugoloths 
are neutral evil. 

Chaotic evil (CE) creatures act with arbitrary violence, 
spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust. Demons, red 
dragons, and orcs are chaotic evil. 


ALIGNMENT IN THE MULTIVERSE 

For many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral 
choice. Humans, dwarves, elves, and other humanoid 
races can choose whether to follow the paths of good or 
evil, law or chaos. According to myth, the good-aligned 
gods who created these races gave them free will to 
choose their moral paths, knowing that good without free 
will is slavery. 

The evil deities who created other races, though, made 
those races to serve them. Those races have strong 
inborn tendencies that match the nature of their gods. 
Most orcs share the violent, savage nature of the orc god, 
Gruumsh, and are thus inclined toward evil. Even if an 
orc chooses a good alignment, it struggles against its in- 
nate tendencies for its entire life. (Even half-orcs feel the 
lingering pull of the orc god’s influence.) 

Alignment is an essential part of the nature of celes- 
tials and fiends. A devil does not choose to be lawful evil, 
and it doesn’t tend toward lawful evil, but rather it is law- 
ful evil in its essence. If it somehow ceased to be lawful 
evil, it would cease to be a devil. 

Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational 
thought do not have alignments—they are unaligned.

TIKA AND ARTEMIS: ALIGNMENT 


Tika Waylan is neutral good, fundamentally good-hearted 
and striving to help others where she can. Artemis is lawful 
evil, unconcerned with the value of sentient life but at least 
professional in his approach to murder. 

As an evil character, Artemis is not an ideal adventurer. 
He began his career as a villain, and only cooperates with 
heroes when he must—and when it’s in his own best 
interests. In most games, evil adventurers cause problems 
in groups alongside others who don’t share their interests 
and objectives. Generally, evil alignments are for villains 
and monsters. 





Such a creature is incapable of making a moral or ethical 
choice and acts according to its bestial nature. Sharks 
are savage predators, for example, but they are not evil; 
they have no alignment. 


LANGUAGES 


Your race indicates the languages your character can 
speak by default, and your background might give you ac- 
cess to one or more additional languages of your choice. 
Note these languages on your character sheet. 

Choose your languages from the Standard Languages 
table, or choose one that is common in your campaign. 
With your DM’s permission, you can instead choose a 
language from the Exotic Languages table or a secret lan- 
guage, such as thieves’ cant or the tongue of druids. 

Some of these languages are actually families of lan- 
guages with many dialects. For example, the Primordial 
language includes the Auran, Aquan, Ignan, and Terran 
dialects, one for each of the four elemental planes. Crea- 
tures that speak different dialects of the same language 
can communicate with one another.

CHAPTER 4: PERSONALITY AND BACKGROUND 











PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS 


Fleshing out your character’s personality—the array of 
traits, mannerisms, habits, beliefs, and flaws that give a 
person a unique identity—will help you bring him or her 
to life as you play the game. Four categories of charac- 
teristics are presented here: personality traits, ideals, 
bonds, and flaws. Beyond those categories, think about 
your character’s favorite words or phrases, tics and habit- 
ual gestures, vices and pet peeves, and whatever else you 
can imagine. 

Each background presented later in this chapter in- 
cludes suggested characteristics that you can use to 
spark your imagination. You're not bound to those op- 
tions, but they’re a good starting point. 


PERSONALITY TRAITS 

Give your character two personality traits. Personality 
traits are small, simple ways to help you set your char- 
acter apart from every other character. Your personality 
traits should tell you something interesting and fun about 
your character. They should be self-descriptions that are 
specific about what makes your character stand out. “I’m 
smart” is not a good trait, because it describes a lot of 
characters. “I’ve read every book in Candlekeep” tells you 
something specific about your character's interests and 
disposition. 

Personality traits might describe the things your char- 
acter likes, his or her past accomplishments, things your 
character dislikes or fears, your character’s self-attitude 
or mannerisms, or the influence of his or her abil- 
ity scores. 

A useful place to start thinking about personality traits 
is to look at your highest and lowest ability scores and de- 
fine one trait related to each. Either one could be positive 
or negative: you might work hard to overcome a low score, 
for example, or be cocky about your high score. 


IDEALS 

Describe one ideal that drives your character. Your ideals 
are the things that you believe in most strongly, the fun- 
damental moral and ethical principles that compel you to 
act as you do. Ideals encompass everything from your life 
goals to your core belief system. 

Ideals might answer any of these questions: What are 
the principles that you will never betray? What would 
prompt you to make sacrifices? What drives you to act 
and guides your goals and ambitions? What is the single 
most important thing you strive for? 

You can choose any ideals you like, but your character’s 
alignment is a good place to start defining them. Each 
background in this chapter includes six suggested ide- 
als. Five of them are linked to aspects of alignment: law, 
chaos, good, evil, and neutrality. The last one has more 
to do with the particular background than with moral or 
ethical perspectives. 


BONDS 

Create one bond for your character. Bonds represent a 
character’s connections to people, places, and events in 
the world. They tie you to things from your background. 
They might inspire you to heights of heroism, or lead 
you to act against your own best interests if they are 


threatened. They can work very much like ideals, driving 
a character’s motivations and goals. 

Bonds might answer any of these questions: Whom do 
you care most about? To what place do you feel a special 
connection? What is your most treasured possession? 

Your bonds might be tied to your class, your 
background, your race, or some other aspect of your char- 
acter’s history or personality. You might also gain new 
bonds over the course of your adventures. 


FLAWS 

Finally, choose a flaw for your character. Your character’s 
flaw represents some vice, compulsion, fear, or weak- 
ness—in particular, anything that someone else could 
exploit to bring you to ruin or cause you to act against 
your best interests. More significant than negative 
personality traits, a flaw might answer any of these ques- 
tions: What enrages you? What’s the one person, concept, 
or event that you are terrified of? What are your vices? 


INSPIRATION 


Inspiration is a rule the Dungeon Master can use to re- 
ward you for playing your character in a way that’s true 

to his or her personality traits, ideal, bond, and flaw. By 
using inspiration, you can draw on your personality trait 
of compassion for the downtrodden to give you an edge in 
negotiating with the Beggar Prince. Or inspiration can let 
you call on your bond to the defense of your home village 
to push past the effect of a spell that has been laid on you. 


GAINING INSPIRATION 


Your DM can choose to give you inspiration for a variety 
of reasons. Typically, DMs award it when you play out 
your personality traits, give in to the drawbacks pre- 
sented by a flaw or bond, and otherwise portray your 
character in a compelling way. Your DM will tell you how 
you can earn inspiration in the game. 

You either have inspiration or you don’t—you can’t 
stockpile multiple “inspirations” for later use. 


USING INSPIRATION 


If you have inspiration, you can expend it when you make 
an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. Spending 
your inspiration gives you advantage on that roll. 





TIKA AND ARTEMIS: CHARACTER DETAILS 

Consider how the names Tika Waylan and Artemis Entreri 
set these characters apart from each other and reflect their 
personalities. Tika is a young woman determined to prove 
that she’s not just a kid any more, and her name makes her 
sound young and ordinary. Artemis Entreri comes from an 
exotic land and carries a more mysterious name. 

Tika is nineteen years old at the start of her adventuring 
career and has auburn hair, green eyes, fair skin with 
freckles, and a mole on her right hip. Artemis is a small 
man, compact and all wiry muscle. He has angular features 
and high cheekbones, and he always seems in need of a 
shave. His raven-black hair is thick and full, but his eyes 
are gray and lifeless—betraying the emptiness of his 
life and soul.

 eeeeeEEEEeEeEeEeEeEeEeEOEeeEEe 
TIKA AND ARTEMIS: PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS 
Tika and Artemis have distinct personality traits. Tika 
Waylan dislikes boastfulness and has a fear of heights 
resulting from a bad fall during her career as a thief. Artemis 
Entreri is always prepared for the worst and moves with a 
quick, precise confidence. 

Consider their ideals. Tika Waylan is innocent, almost 
childlike, believing in the value of life and the importance 
of appreciating everyone. Neutral good in alignment, she 
cleaves to ideals of life and respect. Artemis Entreri never 
allows his emotions to master him, and he constantly 
challenges himself to improve his skills. His lawful 
evil alignment gives him ideals of impartiality and a 
lust for power. 

Tika Waylan’s bond is to the Inn of the Last Home. 

The inn’s proprietor gave her a new chance at life, and 
her friendship with her adventuring companions was 
forged during her time working there. Its destruction by 
the marauding dragonarmies gives Tika a very personal 
reason to hate them with a fiery passion. Her bond 

might be phrased as “I will do whatever it takes to 

punish the dragonarmies for the destruction of the Inn of 
the Last Home.” 

Artemis Entreri’s bond is a strange, almost paradoxical 
relationship with Drizzt Do’Urden, his equal in swordplay 
and grim determination. In his first battle with Drizzt, 
Artemis recognized something of himself in his opponent, 
some indication that if his life had gone differently, he 
might have led a life more like the heroic drow’s. From that 
moment, Artemis is more than a criminal assassin—he 
is an antihero, driven by his rivalry with Drizzt. His bond 
might be phrased as “I will not rest until | have proved 
myself better than Drizzt Do’Urden.” 

Each of these characters also has an important flaw. 
Tika Waylan is naive and emotionally vulnerable, younger 
than her companions and annoyed that they still think 
of her as the kid they knew years ago. She might even be 
tempted to act against her principles if she’s convinced that 
a particular achievement would demonstrate her maturity. 
Artemis Entreri is completely walled off from any personal 
relationship and just wants to be left alone. 


TT a 


Additionally, if you have inspiration, you can reward 
another player for good roleplaying, clever thinking, or 
simply doing something exciting in the game. When 
another player character does something that really con- 
tributes to the story in a fun and interesting way, you can 
give up your inspiration to give that character inspiration. 


BACKGROUNDS 


Every story has a beginning. Your character’s back- 
ground reveals where you came from, how you became 
an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your fighter 
might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled sol- 
dier. Your wizard could have been a sage or an artisan. 
Your rogue might have gotten by as a guild thief or com- 
manded audiences as a jester. 

Choosing a background provides you with important 
story cues about your character’s identity. The most im- 
portant question to ask about your background is what 
changed? Why did you stop doing whatever your back- 
ground describes and start adventuring? Where did you 
get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you 
come from a wealthy background, why don’t you have 


more money? How did you learn the skills of your class? 
What sets you apart from ordinary people who share 
your background? 

The sample backgrounds in this chapter provide both 
concrete benefits (features, proficiencies, and languages) 
and roleplaying suggestions. 


PROFICIENCIES 
Each background gives a character proficiency in two 
skills. Skills are described in chapter 7. 

In addition, most backgrounds give a character 
proficiency with one or more tools. Tools and tool profi- 
ciencies are detailed in chapter 5. 

If a character would gain the same proficiency from 
two different sources, he or she can choose a different 
proficiency of the same kind (skill or tool) instead. 


LANGUAGES 

Some backgrounds also allow characters to learn 
additional languages beyond those given by race. 
See “Languages” earlier in this chapter. 


EQUIPMENT 

Each background provides a package of starting equip- 
ment. If you use the optional rule from chapter 5 to spend 
coin on gear, you do not receive the starting equipment 
from your background. 


SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS 

A background contains suggested personal charac- 
teristics based on your background. You can pick 
characteristics, roll dice to determine them randomly, or 
use the suggestions as inspiration for characteristics of 
your own creation. 


CUSTOMIZING A BACKGROUND 
You might want to tweak some of the features of a back- 
ground so it better fits your character or the campaign 
setting. To customize a background, you can replace 
one feature with any other one, choose any two skills, 
and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages 
from the sample backgrounds. You can either use the 
equipment package from your background or spend coin 
on gear as described in chapter 5. (If you spend coin, you 
can’t also take the equipment package suggested for your 
class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one ideal, 
one bond, and one flaw. If you can’t find a feature that 
matches your desired background, work with your DM to 
create one. 
ee 

TIKA AND ARTEMIS: BACKGROUNDS 

Tika Waylan and Artemis Entreri both lived their earliest 

years as street urchins. Tika’s later career as a barmaid 

didn’t really change her, so she might choose the urchin 

background, gaining proficiency in the Sleight of Hand and 

Stealth skills, and learning the tools of the thieving trade. 

Artemis is more defined by his criminal background, giving 

him skills in Deception and Stealth, as well as proficiency 

with the tools of thievery and poison.

CHAPTER 4: PERSONALITY AND BACKGROUND

38 





ACOLYTE 


You have spent your life in the service of a temple toa 
specific god or pantheon of gods. You act as an intermedi- 
ary between the realm of the holy and the mortal world, 
performing sacred rites and offering sacrifices in order to 
conduct worshipers into the presence of the divine. You 
are not necessarily a cleric—performing sacred rites is 
not the same thing as channeling divine power. 

Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi- 
divine being, and work with your DM to detail the nature 
of your religious service. Appendix B contains a sample 
pantheon, from the Forgotten Realms setting. Were you 
a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from childhood 
to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a 
high priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your 
god in a different way? Perhaps you were the leader of a 
small cult outside of any established temple structure, or 
even an occult group that served a fiendish master that 
you now deny. 


Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Religion 

Languages: Two of your choice 

Equipment: A holy symbol (a gift to you when you 
entered the priesthood), a prayer book or prayer wheel, 
5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of common clothes, 
and a pouch containing 15 gp 


FEATURE: SHELTER OF THE FAITHFUL 

As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who 
share your faith, and you can perform the religious 
ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring com- 
panions can expect to receive free healing and care at 

a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your 
faith, though you must provide any material components 
needed for spells. Those who share your religion will sup- 
port you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle. 

You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated 
to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a resi- 
dence there. This could be the temple where you used to 
serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple 
where you have found a new home. While near your tem- 
ple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided 
the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you re- 
main in good standing with your temple. 


SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS 

Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or 
other religious communities. Their study of the history 
and tenets of their faith and their relationships to tem- 
ples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their mannerisms and 
ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or 
heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.

CHAPTER 4: PERSONALITY AND BACKGROUND 











CRIMINAL 


You are an experienced criminal with a history of 
breaking the law. You have spent a lot of time among 
other criminals and still have contacts within the 
criminal underworld. You're far closer than most people 
to the world of murder, theft, and violence that pervades 
the underbelly of civilization, and you have survived up to 
this point by flouting the rules and regulations of society. 


Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Stealth 

Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set, 
thieves’ tools 

Equipment: A crowbar, a set of dark common clothes 
including a hood, and a pouch containing 15 gp 


CRIMINAL SPECIALTY 

There are many kinds of criminals, and within a thieves’ 
guild or similar criminal organization, individual mem- 
bers have particular specialties. Even criminals who 
operate outside of such organizations have strong pref- 
erences for certain kinds of crimes over others. Choose 
the role you played in your criminal life, or roll on the 
table below. 


d8_ = Specialty d8 = Specialty 

1 Blackmailer 5 Highway robber 
2 Burglar 6 Hired killer 

3. Enforcer 7 Pickpocket 

4 Fence 8 Smuggler 


FEATURE: CRIMINAL CONTACT 

You have a reliable and trustworthy contact who acts as 
your liaison to a network of other criminals. You know 
how to get messages to and from your contact, even over 
great distances; specifically, you know the local messen- 
gers, corrupt caravan masters, and seedy sailors who can 
deliver messages for you. 


SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS 

Criminals might seem like villains on the surface, and 
many of them are villainous to the core. But some have 
an abundance of endearing, if not redeeming, character- 
istics. There might be honor among thieves, but criminals 
rarely show any respect for law or authority. 


VARIANT CRIMINAL: SPY 

Although your capabilities are not much different from 
those of a burglar or smuggler, you learned and practiced 
them in a very different context: as an espionage agent. 
You might have been an officially sanctioned agent of the 
crown, or perhaps you sold the secrets you uncovered to 
the highest bidder.

| am always calm, no matter what the situation. | never

The first thing | do in a new place is note the locations 
of everything valuable—or where such things 

could be hidden. 

| would rather make a new friend than a new enemy. 

| am incredibly slow to trust. Those who seem the 
fairest often have the most to hide. 

| don’t pay attention to the risks in a situation. Never tell

The best way to get me to do something is to tell me |

Bond 

I’m trying to pay off an old debt | owe to a 

generous benefactor. 

My ill-gotten gains go to support my family. 
Something important was taken from me, and | aim to 
steal it back. 

| will become the greatest thief that ever lived. 

I’m guilty of a terrible crime. | hope | can redeem 
myself for it. 

Someone | loved died because of | mistake | made. That 
will never happen again. 


Flaw 

When | see something valuable, | can’t think about 
anything but how to steal it. 

When faced with a choice between money and my 
friends, | usually choose the money. 

If there’s a plan, I'll forget it. If | don’t forget it, 

I'll ignore it. 

| have a “tell” that reveals when I’m lying. 

| turn tail and run when things look bad. 

An innocent person is in prison for a crime that | 
committed. I’m okay with that. 


CHAPTER 4: PERSONALITY AND BACKGROUND 











FOLK HERO 


You come from a humble social rank, but you are 
destined for so much more. Already the people of 
your home village regard you as their champion, and 
your destiny calls you to stand against the tyrants and 
monsters that threaten the common folk everywhere. 


Skill Proficiencies: Animal Handling, Survival 

Tool Proficiencies: One type of artisan’s tools, 
vehicles (land) 

Equipment: A set of artisan’s tools (one of your choice), 
a shovel, an iron pot, a set of common clothes, anda 
pouch containing 10 gp 


DEFINING EVENT 

You previously pursued a simple profession among the 
peasantry, perhaps as a farmer, miner, servant, shepherd, 
woodcutter, or gravedigger. But something happened that 
set you on a different path and marked you for greater 
things. Choose or randomly determine a defining event 
that marked you as a hero of the people. 


d10 Defining Event 
1 | stood up to a tyrant’s agents. 
| saved people during a natural disaster. 
| stood alone against a terrible monster. 
| stole from a corrupt merchant to help the poor. 
| led a militia to fight off an invading army. 


nuk WW DP 


| broke into a tyrant’s castle and stole weapons to 

arm the people. 

7 _ | trained the peasantry to use farm implements as 
weapons against a tyrant’s soldiers. 

8  Alord rescinded an unpopular decree after | led a 
symbolic act of protest against it. 

9  Acelestial, fey, or similar creature gave me a blessing or 
revealed my secret origin. 

10 Recruited into a lord’s army, | rose to leadership and 

was commended for my heroism. 


FEATURE: RUSTIC HOSPITALITY 

Since you come from the ranks of the common folk, you 
fit in among them with ease. You can find a place to hide, 
rest, or recuperate among other commoners, unless you 
have shown yourself to be a danger to them. They will 
shield you from the law or anyone else searching for you, 
though they will not risk their lives for you. 


SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS 

A folk hero is one of the common people, for better or for 
worse. Most folk heroes look on their humble origins as 
a virtue, not a shortcoming, and their home communities 
remain very important to them.

Flaw 

The tyrant who rules my land will stop at nothing to

I’m convinced of the significance of my destiny, and 
blind to my shortcomings and the risk of failure. 

The people who knew me when | was young know my 
shameful secret, so | can never go home again. 

| have a weakness for the vices of the city, 

especially hard drink. 

Secretly, | believe that things would be better if | were a

CHAPTER 4: PERSONALITY AND BACKGROUND 











NOBLE 


You understand wealth, power, and privilege. You carry 
a noble title, and your family owns land, collects taxes, 
and wields significant political influence. You might be 

a pampered aristocrat unfamiliar with work or discom- 
fort, a former merchant just elevated to the nobility, or 

a disinherited scoundrel with a disproportionate sense 
of entitlement. Or you could be an honest, hard-working 
landowner who cares deeply about the people who live 
and work on your land, keenly aware of your responsibil- 
ity to them. 

Work with your DM to come up with an appropriate ti- 
tle and determine how much authority that title carries. A 
noble title doesn’t stand on its own—it’s connected to an 
entire family, and whatever title you hold, you will pass it 
down to your own children. Not only do you need to deter- 
mine your noble title, but you should also work with the 
DM to describe your family and their influence on you. 

Is your family old and established, or was your title only 
recently bestowed? How much influence do they wield, 
and over what area? What kind of reputation does your 
family have among the other aristocrats of the region? 
How do the common people regard them? 

What’s your position in the family? Are you the heir to 
the head of the family? Have you already inherited the ti- 
tle? How do you feel about that responsibility? Or are you 
so far down the line of inheritance that no one cares what 
you do, as long as you don’t embarrass the family? How 
does the head of your family feel about your adventuring 
career? Are you in your family’s good graces, or shunned 
by the rest of your family? 

Does your family have a coat of arms? An insignia you 
might wear on a signet ring? Particular colors you wear 
all the time? An animal you regard as a symbol of your 
line or even a spiritual member of the family? 

These details help establish your family and your title 
as features of the world of the campaign. 


Skill Proficiencies: History, Persuasion 

Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set 

Languages: One of your choice 

Equipment: A set of fine clothes, a signet ring, a scroll of 
pedigree, and a purse containing 25 gp 


FEATURE: POSITION OF PRIVILEGE 

Thanks to your noble birth, people are inclined to think 
the best of you. You are welcome in high society, and 
people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. 
The common folk make every effort to accommodate you 
and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high birth 
treat you as a member of the same social sphere. You can 
secure an audience with a local noble if you need to. 


SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS 

Nobles are born and raised to a very different lifestyle 
than most people ever experience, and their personalities 
reflect that upbringing. A noble title comes with a pleth- 
ora of bonds—responsibilities to family, to other nobles 
(including the sovereign), to the people entrusted to the 
family’s care, or even to the title itself. But this responsi- 
bility is often a good way to undermine a noble.

to my family.

RICHARD WHITTERS 


SAGE 


You spent years learning the lore of the multiverse. You 


scoured manuscripts, studied scrolls, and listened to the 
greatest experts on the subjects that interest you. Your 
efforts have made you a master in your fields of study. 


Skill Proficiencies: Arcana, History 

Languages: Two of your choice 

Equipment: A bottle of black ink, a quill, a small knife, a 
letter from a dead colleague posing a question you have 
not yet been able to answer, a set of common clothes,

4 Librarian 


FEATURE: RESEARCHER 

When you attempt to learn or recall a piece of lore, if you 
do not know that information, you often know where and 
from whom you can obtain it. Usually, this information 
comes from a library, scriptorium, university, or a sage 
or other learned person or creature. Your DM might rule 
that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an al- 


most inaccessible place, or that it simply cannot be found. 


Unearthing the deepest secrets of the multiverse can re- 
quire an adventure or even a whole campaign. 


SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS 

Sages are defined by their extensive studies, and their 
characteristics reflect this life of study. Devoted to 
scholarly pursuits, a sage values knowledge highly— 
sometimes in its own right, sometimes as a means 
toward other ideals.

SOLDIER 


War has been your life for as long as you care to remem- 
ber. You trained as a youth, studied the use of weapons 
and armor, learned basic survival techniques, including 
how to stay alive on the battlefield. You might have been 
part of a standing national army or a mercenary com- 
pany, or perhaps a member of a local militia who rose to 
prominence during a recent war. 

When you choose this background, work with your DM 
to determine which military organization you were a part 
of, how far through its ranks you progressed, and what 
kind of experiences you had during your military career. 
Was it a standing army, a town guard, or a village militia? 
Or it might have been a noble’s or merchant’s private 
army, or a mercenary company. 


Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Intimidation 

Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set, 
vehicles (land) 

Equipment: An insignia of rank, a trophy taken from 
a fallen enemy (a dagger, broken blade, or piece of a 
banner), a set of bone dice or deck of cards, a set of 
common clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp 


SPECIALTY 

During your time as a soldier, you had a specific role to 
play in your unit or army. Roll a d8 or choose from the op- 
tions in the table below to determine your role: 


d8 = Specialty d8_— Specialty 

1 Officer Quartermaster 

2 Scout 7 Standard bearer 

3. Infantry 8 Support staff 

4 Cavalry (cook, blacksmith, 
5 Healer or the like) 


FEATURE: MILITARY RANK 

You have a military rank from your career as a soldier. 
Soldiers loyal to your former military organization still 
recognize your authority and influence, and they defer to 
you if they are of a lower rank. You can invoke your rank 
to exert influence over other soldiers and requisition sim- 
ple equipment or horses for temporary use. You can also 
usually gain access to friendly military encampments and 
fortresses where your rank is recognized. 


SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS 

The horrors of war combined with the rigid discipline of 
military service leave their mark on all soldiers, shaping 
their ideals, creating strong bonds, and often leaving 
them scarred and vulnerable to fear, shame, and hatred.

CHAPTER 4: PERSONALITY AND BACKGROUND 











CHAPTER 5: EQUIPMENT 


THE MARKETPLACE OF A LARGE CITY TEEMS WITH BUYERS 
and sellers of many sorts: dwarf smiths and elf woodcarv- 
ers, halfling farmers and gnome jewelers, not to mention 
humans of every shape, size, and color drawn from a 
spectrum of nations and cultures. In the largest cities, 
almost anything imaginable is offered for sale, from ex- 
otic spices and luxurious clothing to wicker baskets and 
practical swords. 

For an adventurer, the availability of armor, weapons, 
backpacks, rope, and similar goods is of paramount 
importance, since proper equipment can mean the differ- 
ence between life and death in a dungeon or the untamed 
wilds. This chapter details the mundane and exotic mer- 
chandise that adventurers commonly find useful in the face 
of the threats that the worlds of D&amp;D present. 


STARTING EQUIPMENT 


When you create your character, you receive equipment 
based on a combination of your class and background. 
Alternatively, you can start with a number of gold pieces 
based on your class and spend them on items from the 
lists in this chapter. See the Starting Wealth by Class ta- 
ble to determine how much gold you have to spend. 

You decide how your character came by this starting 
equipment. It might have been an inheritance, or goods 
that the character purchased during his or her upbringing. 
You might have been equipped with a weapon, armor, and 
a backpack as part of military service. You might even have 
stolen your gear. A weapon could be a family heirloom, 
passed down from generation to generation until your 
character finally took up the mantle and followed in an 
ancestor’s adventurous footsteps. 


STARTING WEALTH BY CLASS 


Class Funds 

Cleric 5d4 x 10 gp 

Fighter 5d4 x 10 gp 

Rogue 4d4 x 10 gp 

Wizard 4d4 x 10 gp 
WEALTH 


Wealth appears in many forms in a D&amp;D world. Coins, 
gemstones, trade goods, art objects, animals, and prop- 
erty can reflect your character’s financial well-being. 
Members of the peasantry trade in goods, bartering for 
what they need and paying taxes in grain and cheese. 
Members of the nobility trade either in legal rights, such 
as the rights to a mine, a port, or farmland, or in gold 
bars, measuring gold by the pound rather than by the 
coin. Only merchants, adventurers, and those offering pro- 
fessional services for hire commonly deal in coins. 


COINAGE 

Common coins come in several different denominations 
based on the relative worth of the metal from which they 
are made. The three most common coins are the gold 
piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp). 


With one gold piece, a character can buy a bedroll, 50 
feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) 
artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is 
the standard unit of measure for wealth, even if the coin 
itself is not commonly used. When merchants discuss 
deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or 
thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don’t usually 
involve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold 
piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual ex- 
change is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods. 

One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most 
prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys 
a laborer’s work for half a day, a flask of lamp oil, or a 
night’s rest in a poor inn. 

One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are 
common among laborers and beggars. A single copper 
piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk. 

In addition, unusual coins made of other precious met- 
als sometimes appear in treasure hoards. The electrum 
piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from 
fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes 
arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transac- 
tions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, anda 
platinum piece is worth ten gold pieces. 

A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, 
so fifty coins weigh a pound. 


STANDARD EXCHANGE RATES 


Coin cp sp ep sp pp 
Copper (cp) 1 110 1/50 1/100  1/1,000 
Silver (sp) 10 1 1/5 110 ~—-:1/100 
Electrum (ep) 50 5 1 1/2 1/20 
Gold (gp) 100 10 2 1 1/10 
Platinum (pp) 1,000 100 20 10 1 


SELLING TREASURE 

Opportunities abound to find treasure, equipment, 
weapons, armor, and more in the dungeons you explore. 
Normally, you can sell your treasures and trinkets when 
you return to a town or other settlement, provided that you 
can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot. 

Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment. As a general 
rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment 
fetch half their cost when sold in a market. Weapons and 
armor used by monsters are rarely in good enough condi- 
tion to sell. 

Magic Items. Selling magic items is problematic. Find- 
ing someone to buy a potion or a scroll isn’t too hard, but 
other items are out of the realm of most but the wealthiest 
nobles. Likewise, aside from a few common magic items, 
you won't normally come across magic items or spells to 
purchase. The value of magic is far beyond simple gold 
and should always be treated as such. 

Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects. These items retain 
their full value in the marketplace, and you can either 
trade them in for coin or use them as currency for other 
transactions. For exceptionally valuable treasures, the 


CHAPTER 5: EQUIPMENT 





D&amp;D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission grantec 


to print and photocopy this document for personal use only 





DM might require you to find a buyer in a large town or 
larger community first. 

Trade Goods. On the borderlands, many people con- 
duct transactions through barter. Like gems and art 
objects, trade goods—hbars of iron, bags of salt, livestock, 
and so on—retain their full value in the market and can 
be used as currency. 


ARMOR AND SHIELDS 


D&amp;D worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many dif- 
ferent cultures, each with its own technology level. For 
this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of ar- 
mor types, ranging from leather armor to chain mail to 
costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in 
between. The Armor table collects the most commonly 
available types of armor found in the game and separates 
them into three categories: light armor, medium armor, 
and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor 
with a shield. 

The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other 
properties of the common types of armor worn in the 
worlds of D&amp;D. 

Armor Proficiency. Anyone can put on a suit of armor 
or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the 
armor’s use know how to wear it effectively, however. 
Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of 
armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, 
you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, 
or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you 
can’t cast spells. 

Armor Class (AC). Armor protects its wearer from at- 
tacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your 
base Armor Class. 

Heavy Armor. Heavier armor interferes with the wear- 
er’s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the 
Armor table shows “Str 13” or “Str 15” in the Strength 
column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wear- 
er’s speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength 
score equal to or higher than the listed score. 


ARMOR 
Armor Cost Armor Class (AC) 
Light Armor 
Padded 5 gp 11 + Dex modifier 
Leather 10 gp 11 + Dex modifier 
Studded leather 45 gp 12 + Dex modifier 
Medium Armor 
Hide 10 gp 12 + Dex modifier (max 2) 
Chain shirt 50 gp 13 + Dex modifier (max 2) 
Scale mail 50 gp 14 + Dex modifier (max 2) 
Breastplate 400 gp 14 + Dex modifier (max 2) 
Half plate 750 gp 15 + Dex modifier (max 2) 
Heavy Armor 
Ring mail 30 gp 14 
Chain mail 75 gp 16 
Splint 200 gp 7 
Plate 1,500 gp 18 
Shield 
Shield 10 gp +2 


sss 

VARIANT: EQUIPMENT SIZES 
In most campaigns, you can use or wear any equipment 
that you find on your adventures, within the bounds of 
common sense. For example, a burly half-orc won't fit in a 
halfling’s leather armor, and a gnome would be swallowed 
up in a cloud giant’s elegant robe. 

The DM can impose more realism. For example, a suit 
of plate armor made for one human might not fit another 
one without significant alterations, and a guard’s uniform 
might be visibly ill-fitting when an adventurer tries to wear it 
as a disguise. 

Using this variant, when adventurers find armor, clothing, 
and similar items that are made to be worn, they might 
need to visit an armorsmith, tailor, leatherworker, or similar 
expert to make the item wearable. The cost for such work 
varies from 10 to 40 percent of the market price of the item. 
The DM can either roll 1d4 x 10 or determine the increase 
in cost based on the extent of the alterations required. 

error — ee 


Stealth. If the Armor table shows “Disadvantage” in 
the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dex- 
terity (Stealth) checks. 

Shields. A shield is made from wood or metal and is 
carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your 
Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield 
at a time. 


LIGHT ARMOR 


Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors 
agile adventurers since it offers some protection without 
sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your 
Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armor 
type to determine your Armor Class. 

Padded. Padded armor consists of quilted layers of 
cloth and batting. 

Leather. The breastplate and shoulder protectors of 
this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by 
being boiled in oil. The rest of the armor is made of softer 
and more flexible materials. 

Studded Leather. Made from tough but flexible 
leather, studded leather is reinforced with close-set rivets 
or spikes.

MEDIUM ARMOR 


Medium armor offers more protection than light armor, 
but it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium 
armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum 
of +2, to the base number from your armor type to deter- 
mine your Armor Class. 

Hide. This crude armor consists of thick furs and pelts. 
It is commonly worn by barbarian tribes, evil humanoids, 
and other folk who lack access to the tools and materials 
needed to create better armor. 

Chain Shirt. Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain 
shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This 
armor offers modest protection to the wearer’s upper 
body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against 
one another to be muffled by outer layers. 

Scale Mail. This armor consists of a coat and leggings 
(and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with 
overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a 
fish. The suit includes gauntlets. 

Breastplate. This armor consists of a fitted metal chest 
piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the 
legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor provides 
good protection for the wearer’s vital organs while leav- 
ing the wearer relatively unencumbered. 

Half Plate. Half plate consists of shaped metal plates 
that cover most of the wearer’s body. It does not include 
leg protection beyond simple greaves that are attached 
with leather straps. 


HEAVY ARMOR 


Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best 
protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body 
and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only 
proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk. 

Heavy armor doesn’t let you add your Dexterity modi- 
fier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn’t penalize you 
if your Dexterity modifier is negative. 

Ring Mail. This armor is leather armor with heavy 
rings sewn into it. The rings help reinforce the armor 
against blows from swords and axes. Ring mail is inferior 
to chain mail, and it’s usually worn only by those who 
can’t afford better armor. 

Chain Mail. Made of interlocking metal rings, chain 
mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath 
the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of 
blows. The suit includes gauntlets. 

Splint. This armor is made of narrow vertical strips 
of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over 
cloth padding. Flexible chain mail protects the joints. 

Plate. Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal 
plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes 
gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and 
thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles 
and straps distribute the weight over the body. 


GETTING INTO AND OUT OF ARMOR 


The time it takes to don or doff a type of armor or a shield 
is shown in the Donning and Doffing Armor table. 
Don. This is the time it takes to put on the item. You 
benefit from its AC only if you take the full time to don it. 
Doff. This is the time it takes to take off the item. If you 
have help removing armor, reduce this time by half. 


DONNING AND DOFFING ARMOR 


Category Don Doff 
Light Armor 1 minute 1 minute 
Medium Armor 5 minutes 1 minute 
Heavy Armor 10 minutes 5 minutes 
Shield 1 action 1 action 


WEAPONS 


Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflect- 
ing both the class’s focus and the tools you are most likely 
to use. Whether you favor a longsword or a longbow, your 
weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean 
the difference between life and death while adventuring. 

The Weapons table shows the most common weapons 
used in the worlds of D&amp;D, their price and weight, the 
damage they deal when they hit, and any special prop- 
erties they possess. Every weapon is classified as either 
melee or ranged. A melee weapon is used to attack a 
target within 5 feet of you, whereas a ranged weapon is 
used to attack a target at a distance. 


WEAPON PROFICIENCY 


Your race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency 
with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two 
categories are simple and martial. Most people can 
use simple weapons with proficiency. These weapons 
include clubs, maces, and other weapons often found in 
the hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including 
swords, axes, and polearms, require more specialized 
training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial 
weapons because these weapons put their fighting style 
and training to best use. 

Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your pro- 
ficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make 
with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a 
weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add 
your proficiency bonus to the attack roll. 


WEAPON PROPERTIES 


Many weapons have special properties related to their use, 
as shown in the Weapons table. 

Ammunition. You can use a weapon that has the am- 
munition property to make a ranged attack only if you 
have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you 
attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammu- 
nition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or 
other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand 
to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, 
you can recover half your expended ammunition by tak- 
ing a minute to search the battlefield. 

If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to 
make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised 
weapon (see “Improvised Weapons” later in the section). 
Asling must be loaded to deal any damage when used 
in this way. 

Finesse. When making an attack with a finesse 
weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexter- 
ity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use 
the same modifier for both rolls.

Heavy. Small creatures have disadvantage on at- 
tack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon’s size 
and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use 
effectively. 

Light. A light weapon is small and easy to handle, mak- 
ing it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons. See 
the rules for two-weapon fighting in chapter 9. 

Loading. Because of the time required to load this 
weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from 
it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to 
fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can nor- 
mally make. 

Range. A weapon that can be used to make a ranged 
attack has a range shown in parentheses after the

ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two 
numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal range in 
feet, and the second indicates the weapon’s long range. 
When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have 
disadvantage on the attack roll. You can’t attack a target 
beyond the weapon’s long range. 

Reach. This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when 
you attack with it, as well as when determining your 
reach for opportunity attacks with it (see chapter 9). 

Special. A weapon with the special property has un- 
usual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon’s 
description (See “Special Weapons” later in this section). 


CHAPTER 5: EQUIPMENT 8 
- ST: 





Thrown. If a weapon has the thrown property, you can 
throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon 
is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for 
that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a 
melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw 
a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dag- 
ger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, 
since the dagger has the finesse property. 

Two-Handed. This weapon requires two hands when 
you attack with it. 

Versatile. This weapon can be used with one or two 
hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the 
property—the damage when the weapon is used with two 
hands to make a melee attack. 


IMPROVISED WEAPONS 

Sometimes characters don’t have their weapons and have 
to attack with whatever is close at hand. An improvised 
weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two 
hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a 
wagon wheel, or a dead goblin. 

In many cases, an improvised weapon is similar to an 
actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a 
table leg is akin to a club. At the DM’s option, a character 
proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it 
were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus. 

An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 
1d4 damage (the DM assigns a damage type appropri- 
ate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon 
to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that 
does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 dam- 
age. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range 
of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. 


SILVERED WEAPONS 

Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to 
nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, 
so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their 
weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon or 
ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp. This cost represents 
not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise 
needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less 
effective. 


SPECIAL WEAPONS 
Weapons with special rules are described here. 

Lance. You have disadvantage when you use a lance to 
attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires 
two hands to wield when you aren’t mounted. 

Net. A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is re- 
strained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures 
that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. 

A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength 
check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach 
on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 
10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the 
effect and destroying the net. 

When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to at- 
tack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless 
of the number of attacks you can normally make. 


ADVENTURING GEAR 


This section describes items that have special rules or 
require further explanation. 

Acid. As an action, you can splash the contents of this 
vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial 
up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make 
a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the 
acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 
2d6 acid damage. 

Alchemist’s Fire. This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites 
when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this 
flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged 
attack against a creature or object, treating the alche- 
mist’s fire as an improvised weapon. Ona hit, the target 
takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each ofits turns. A 
creature can end this damage by using its action to make 
a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames. 

Antitoxin. A creature that drinks this vial of liquid 
gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 
hour. It confers no benefit to undead or constructs. 

Arcane Focus. An arcane focus is a special item—an 
orb, a crystal, a rod, a specially constructed staff, a wand- 
like length of wood, or some similar item—designed to 
channel the power of arcane spells. A sorcerer, warlock, 
or wizard can use such an item as a spellcasting focus, as 
described in chapter 10. 

Ball Bearings. As an action, you can spill these tiny 
metal balls from their pouch to cover a level, square area 
that is 10 feet on a side. A creature moving across the 
covered area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving 
throw or fall prone. A creature moving through the area 
at half speed doesn’t need to make the saving throw. 

Block and Tackle. A set of pulleys with a cable 
threaded through them and a hook to attach to objects, a 
block and tackle allows you to hoist up to four times the 
weight you can normally lift. 

Book. A book might contain poetry, historical ac- 
counts, information pertaining to a particular field of 
lore, diagrams and notes on gnomish contraptions, or just 
about anything else that can be represented using text or 
pictures. A book of spells is a spellbook (described later 
in this section). 

Caltrops. As an action, you can spread a single bag 
of caltrops to cover a 5-foot-square area. Any creature 
that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity 
saving throw or stop moving and take 1 piercing dam- 
age. Until the creature regains at least 1 hit point, its 
walking speed is reduced by 10 feet. A creature moving 
through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the 
saving throw. 

Candle. For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 
5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. 

Case, Crossbow Bolt. This wooden case can hold up to 
twenty crossbow bolts. 

Case, Map or Scroll. This cylindrical leather case can 
hold up to ten rolled-up sheets of paper or five rolled-up 
sheets of parchment. 

Chain. A chain has 10 hit points. It can be burst with a 
successful DC 20 Strength check. 

Climber’s Kit. A climber’s kit includes special pitons, 
boot tips, gloves, and a harness. You can use the climb- 
er’s kit as an action to anchor yourself; when you do, you

can’t fall more than 25 feet from the point where you 
anchored yourself, and you can’t climb more than 25 feet 
away from that point without undoing the anchor. 

Component Pouch. A component pouch is a small, wa- 
tertight leather belt pouch that has compartments to hold 
all the material components and other special items you 
need to cast your spells, except for those components that 
have a specific cost (as indicated in a spell’s description). 

Crowbar. Using a crowbar grants advantage to Strength 
checks where the crowbar’s leverage can be applied. 

Druidic Focus. A druidic focus might be a sprig of mis- 
tletoe or holly, a wand or scepter made of yew or another 
special wood, a staff drawn whole out of a living tree, or a 
totem object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, and teeth 
from sacred animals. A druid (See chapter 3 of the Player’s 
Handbook) can use such an object as a spellcasting focus, 
as described in chapter 10. 

Fishing Tackle. This kit includes a wooden rod, silken 
line, corkwood bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet 
lures, and narrow netting. 

Healer’s Kit. This kit is a leather pouch containing 
bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As 
an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a 
creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a 
Wisdom (Medicine) check. 

Holy Symbol. A holy symbol is a representation of 
a god or pantheon. It might be an amulet depicting a 
symbol representing a deity, the same symbol carefully 
engraved or inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny box 
holding a fragment of a sacred relic. The Player’s Hand- 
book lists many gods in the multiverse and their typical 
symbols. A cleric or paladin can use a holy symbol as a 
spellcasting focus, as described in chapter 10. To use the 
symbol in this way, the caster must hold it in hand, wear 
it visibly, or bear it on a shield. 

Holy Water. As an action, you can splash the contents 
of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw 
it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, 
make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating 
the holy water as an improvised weapon. If the target is a 
fiend or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage. 

A cleric or paladin may create holy water by performing 
a special ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses 
25 gp worth of powdered silver, and requires the caster to 
expend a Ist-level spell slot. 

Hunting Trap. When you use your action to set it, this 
trap forms a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when 
a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The 
trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, 
such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A crea- 
ture that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 13 
Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and 
stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free 
of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the 
chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its action 
to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another 
creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check 
deals 1 piercing damage to the trapped creature. 

Lamp. A lamp casts bright light in a 15-foot radius and 
dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 
hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. 


Lantern, Bullseye. A bullseye lantern casts bright light 
in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. 
Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. 

Lantern, Hooded. A hooded lantern casts bright light 
in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. 
Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. As 
an action, you can lower the hood, reducing the light to 
dim light in a 5-foot radius. 

Lock. A key is provided with the lock. Without the key, 
a creature proficient with thieves’ tools can pick this lock 
with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Your DM may 
decide that better locks are available for higher prices. 

Magnifying Glass. This lens allows a closer look at 
small objects. It is also useful as a substitute for flint and 
steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magni- 
fying glass requires light as bright as sunlight to focus, 
tinder to ignite, and about 5 minutes for the fire to ignite. 
A magnifying glass grants advantage on any ability check 
made to appraise or inspect an item that is small or 
highly detailed. 

Manacles. These metal restraints can bind a Small 
or Medium creature. Escaping the manacles requires 
a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Breaking them 
requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. Each 
set of manacles comes with one key. Without the key, 

a creature proficient with thieves’ tools can pick the 
manacles’ lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity 
check. Manacles have 15 hit points.

EQUIPMENT PACKS 


The starting equipment you get from your class includes 

a collection of useful adventuring gear, put together in a 
pack. The contents of these packs are listed here. If you are 
buying your starting equipment, you can purchase a pack 
for the price shown, which might be cheaper than buying 
the items individually. 

Burglar’s Pack (16 gp). Includes a backpack, a bag of 
1,000 ball bearings, 10 feet of string, a bell, 5 candles, a 
crowbar, a hammer, 10 pitons, a hooded lantern, 2 flasks of 
oil, 5 days rations, a tinderbox, and a waterskin. The pack 
also has 50 feet of hempen rope strapped to the side of it. 

Diplomat’s Pack (39 gp). Includes a chest, 2 cases for 
maps and scrolls, a set of fine clothes, a bottle of ink, an 
ink pen, a lamp, 2 flasks of oil, 5 sheets of paper, a vial of 
perfume, sealing wax, and soap. 

Dungeoneer’s Pack (12 gp). Includes a backpack, a 
crowbar, a hammer, 10 pitons, 10 torches, a tinderbox, 10 
days of rations, and a waterskin. The pack also has 50 feet 
of hempen rope strapped to the side of it. 

Entertainer’s Pack (40 gp). Includes a backpack, a bedroll, 
2 costumes, 5 candles, 5 days of rations, a waterskin, and a 
disguise kit. 

Explorer’s Pack (10 gp). Includes a backpack, a bedroll, 

a mess kit, a tinderbox, 10 torches, 10 days of rations, and 
a waterskin. The pack also has 50 feet of hempen rope 
strapped to the side of it. 

Priest’s Pack (19 gp). Includes a backpack, a blanket, 10 
candles, a tinderbox, an alms box, 2 blocks of incense, a 
censer, vestments, 2 days of rations, and a waterskin. 

Scholar’s Pack (40 gp). Includes a backpack, a book of 
lore, a bottle of ink, an ink pen, 10 sheets of parchment, a 
little bag of sand, and a small knife.

Mess Kit. This tin box contains a cup and simple cut- 
lery. The box clamps together, and one side can be used 
as a cooking pan and the other as a plate or shallow bowl. 

Oil. Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. 
As an action, you can splash the oil in this flask onto a 
creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, 
shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a 
target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised 
weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target 
takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 min- 
ute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the 
burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground 
to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface 
is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire 
damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its 
turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only 
once per turn. 

Poison, Basic. You can use the poison in this vial 
to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three 
pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an 
action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammu- 
nition must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or 
take 1d4 poison damage. Once applied, the poison re- 
tains potency for 1 minute before drying. 

Potion of Healing. A character who drinks the magical 
red fluid in this vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Drinking 
or administering a potion takes an action. 

Pouch. A cloth or leather pouch can hold up to 20 sling 
bullets or 50 blowgun needles, among other things. A 
compartmentalized pouch for holding spell components 
is called a component pouch (described earlier in this 
section). 

Quiver. A quiver can hold up to 20 arrows. 

Ram, Portable. You can use a portable ram to break 
down doors. When doing so, you gain a+4 bonus on the 
Strength check. One other character can help you use the 
ram, giving you advantage on this check. 

Rations. Rations consist of dry foods suitable for 
extended travel, including jerky, dried fruit, hard- 
tack, and nuts. 

Rope. Rope, whether made of hemp or silk, has 2 hit 
points and can be burst with a DC 17 Strength check. 

Scale, Merchant’s. A scale includes a small bal- 
ance, pans, and a suitable assortment of weights up to 
2 pounds. With it, you can measure the exact weight 
of small objects, such as raw precious metals or trade 
goods, to help determine their worth. 

Spellbook. Essential for wizards, a spellbook is a 
leather-bound tome with 100 blank vellum pages suitable 
for recording spells. 

Spyglass. Objects viewed through a spyglass are mag- 
nified to twice their size. 

Tent. A simple and portable canvas shelter, a tent 
sleeps two. 

Tinderbox. This small container holds flint, fire steel, 
and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to 
kindle a fire. Using it to light a torch—or anything else 
with abundant, exposed fuel—takes an action. Lighting 
any other fire takes 1 minute. 

Torch. A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light 
in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. 
If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it 
deals 1 fire damage.

TOOLS 


A tool helps you to do something you couldn’t otherwise 
do, such as craft or repair an item, forge a document, or 
pick a lock. Your race, class, background, or feats give 
you proficiency with certain tools. Proficiency with a tool 
allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability 
check you make using that tool. Tool use is not tied to 

a single ability, since proficiency with a tool represents 
broader knowledge of its use. For example, the DM might 
ask you to make a Dexterity check to carve a fine detail 
with your woodcarver’s tools, or a Strength check to 
make something out of particularly hard wood. 

Artisan’s Tools. These special tools include the items 
needed to pursue a craft or trade. The table shows exam- 
ples of the most common types of tools, each providing 
items related to a single craft. Proficiency with a set 
of artisan’s tools lets you add your proficiency bonus 
to any ability checks you make using the tools in your 
craft. Each type of artisan’s tools requires a separate 
proficiency. 

Disguise Kit. This pouch of cosmetics, hair dye, and 
small props lets you create disguises that change your 
physical appearance. Proficiency with this kit lets you 
add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you 
make to create a visual disguise.

Forgery Kit. This small box contains a variety of pa- 
pers and parchments, pens and inks, seals and sealing 
wax, gold and silver leaf, and other supplies necessary to 
create convincing forgeries of physical documents. Profi- 
ciency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to 
any ability checks you make to create a physical forgery 
of a document. 

Gaming Set. This item encompasses a wide range 
of game pieces, including dice and decks of cards (for 
games such as Three-Dragon Ante). A few common 
examples appear on the Tools table, but other kinds of 
gaming sets exist. If you are proficient with a gaming set, 
you can add your proficiency bonus to ability checks you 
make to play a game with that set. Each type of gaming 
set requires a separate proficiency. 

Herbalism Kit. This kit contains a variety of instru- 
ments such as clippers, mortar and pestle, and pouches 
and vials used by herbalists to create remedies and 
potions. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your profi- 
ciency bonus to any ability checks you make to identify or 
apply herbs. Also, proficiency with this kit is required to 
create antitoxin and potions of healing. 

Musical Instrument. Several of the most common 
types of musical instruments are shown on the table 
as examples. If you have proficiency with a given mu- 
sical instrument, you can add your proficiency bonus 
to any ability checks you make to play music with the 


instrument. Each type of musical instrument requires a 
separate proficiency. 

Navigator’s Tools. This set of instruments is used for 
navigation at sea. Proficiency with navigator’s tools lets 
you chart a ship’s course and follow navigation charts. 

In addition, these tools allow you to add your proficiency 
bonus to any ability check you make to avoid getting 
lost at sea. 

Poisoner’s Kit. A poisoner’s kit includes the vials, 
chemicals, and other equipment necessary for the cre- 
ation of poisons. Proficiency with this kit lets you add 
your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to 
craft or use poisons. 

Thieves’ Tools. This set of tools includes a small file, a 
set of lock picks, a small mirror mounted on a metal han- 
dle, a set of narrow-bladed scissors, and a pair of pliers. 
Proficiency with these tools lets you add your proficiency 
bonus to any ability checks you make to disarm traps or 
open locks. 


MOUNTS AND VEHICLES 


A good mount can help you move more quickly through 
the wilderness, but its primary purpose is to carry the 
gear that would otherwise slow you down. The Mounts 
and Other Animals table shows each animal’s speed and 
base carrying capacity. 

An animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled, or 
wagon can move weight up to five times its base carrying 
capacity, including the weight of the vehicle. If multiple 
animals pull the same vehicle, they can add their carry- 
ing capacity together. 

Mounts other than those listed here are available in the 
worlds of D&amp;D, but they are rare and not normally avail- 
able for purchase. These include flying mounts (pegasi, 
griffons, hippogriffs, and similar animals) and even 
aquatic mounts (giant sea horses, for example). Acquiring 
such a mount often means securing an egg and raising 
the creature yourself, making a bargain with a powerful 
entity, or negotiating with the mount itself. 

Barding. Barding is armor designed to protect an 
animal’s head, neck, chest, and body. Any type of armor 
shown on the Armor table in this chapter can be pur- 
chased as barding. The cost is four times the equivalent 
armor made for humanoids, and it weighs twice as much. 

Saddles. A military saddle braces the rider, helping you 
keep your seat on an active mount in battle. It gives you 
advantage on any check you make to remain mounted. 
An exotic saddle is required for riding any aquatic or 
flying mount. 

Vehicle Proficiency. If you have proficiency with a 
certain kind of vehicle (land or water), you can add your 
proficiency bonus to any check you make to control that 
kind of vehicle in difficult circumstances. 

Rowed Vessels. Keelboats and rowboats are used on 
lakes and rivers. If going downstream, add the speed of 
the current (typically 3 miles per hour) to the speed of the 
vehicle. These vehicles can’t be rowed against any signif- 
icant current, but they can be pulled upstream by draft 
animals on the shores. A rowboat weighs 100 pounds, in 
case adventurers carry it over land.

TRADE GOODS 


Most wealth is not in coins. It is measured in livestock, 
grain, land, rights to collect taxes, or rights to resources 
(such as a mine or a forest). 

Guilds, nobles, and royalty regulate trade. Chartered 
companies are granted rights to conduct trade along cer- 
tain routes, to send merchant ships to various ports, or to 
buy or sell specific goods. Guilds set prices for the goods 
or services that they control, and determine who may 
or may not offer those goods and services. Merchants 
commonly exchange trade goods without using currency. 
The Trade Goods table shows the value of commonly ex- 
changed goods.

EXPENSES 


When not descending into the depths of the earth, explor- 
ing ruins for lost treasures, or waging war against the 
encroaching darkness, adventurers face more mundane 
realities. Even in a fantastical world, people require basic 
necessities such as shelter, sustenance, and clothing. 
These things cost money, although some lifestyles cost 
more than others. 


LIFESTYLE EXPENSES 


Lifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to ac- 
count for the cost of living in a fantasy world. They cover 
your accommodations, food and drink, and all your other 
necessities. Furthermore, expenses cover the cost of 
maintaining your equipment so you can be ready when 
adventure next calls. 

At the start of each week or month (your choice), 
choose a lifestyle from the Expenses table and pay the 
price to sustain that lifestyle. The prices listed are per 
day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your chosen 
lifestyle over a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price 
by 30. Your lifestyle might change from one period to the 
next, based on the funds you have at your disposal, or you 
might maintain the same lifestyle throughout your char- 
acter’s career. 

Your lifestyle choice can have consequences. Main- 
taining a wealthy lifestyle might help you make contacts 
with the rich and powerful, though you run the risk of at- 
tracting thieves. Likewise, living frugally might help you 
avoid criminals, but you are unlikely to make powerful 
connections.

Wretched. You live in inhumane conditions. With no 
place to call home, you shelter wherever you can, sneak- 
ing into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying on the 
good graces of people better off than you. A wretched 
lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease, 
and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched 
people covet your armor, weapons, and adventuring gear, 
which represent a fortune by their standards. You are be- 
neath the notice of most people. 

Squalid. You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut 
just outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house 
in the worst part of town. You have shelter from the 
elements, but you live in a desperate and often violent 
environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and 
misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most peo- 
ple, and you have few legal protections. Most people at 
this lifestyle level have suffered some terrible setback. 
They might be disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer 
from disease. 

Poor. A poor lifestyle means going without the com- 
forts available in a stable community. Simple food and 
lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable condi- 
tions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, 
experience. Your accommodations might be a room in 
a flophouse or in the common room above a tavern. You 
benefit from some legal protections, but you still have 
to contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at 
this lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, coste- 
rmongers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and other 
disreputable types. 

Modest. A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums 
and ensures that you can maintain your equipment. You 
live in an older part of town, renting a room in a boarding 
house, inn, or temple. You don’t go hungry or thirsty, and 
your living conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary peo- 
ple living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families, 
laborers, students, priests, hedge wizards, and the like. 

Comfortable. Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means 
that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily maintain 
your equipment. You live in a small cottage in a mid- 
dle-class neighborhood or in a private room at a fine inn. 
You associate with merchants, skilled tradespeople, and 
military officers. 

Wealthy. Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a 
life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the 
social status associated with the old money of nobility or 
royalty. You live a lifestyle comparable to that of a highly 
successful merchant, a favored servant of the royalty, or 
the owner of a few small businesses. You have respect- 
able lodgings, usually a spacious home in a good part of 
town or a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely have a 
small staff of servants. 

Aristocratic. You live a life of plenty and comfort. You 
move in circles populated by the most powerful people 
in the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps 
a townhouse in the nicest part of town or rooms in the 
finest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the 
most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants 
attending to your every need. You receive invitations to 
the social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and spend 
evenings in the company of politicians, guild leaders, 
high priests, and nobility. You must also contend with the 
highest levels of deceit and treachery. The wealthier you 


are, the greater the chance you will be drawn into politi- 
cal intrigue as a pawn or participant. 


Foop, DRINK, AND LODGING

dividual food items and a single night’s lodging. These 
prices are included in your total lifestyle expenses.

SERVICES 


Adventurers can pay nonplayer characters to assist them 
or act on their behalf in a variety of circumstances. Most 
such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others are 
masters of acraft or art, and a few are experts with spe- 
cialized adventuring skills. 

Some of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the 
Services table. Other common hirelings include any of 
the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical town or 
city, when the adventurers pay them to perform a specific 
task. For example, a wizard might pay a carpenter to con- 
struct an elaborate chest (and its miniature replica) for 
use in the Leomund'’s secret chest spell. A fighter might 
commission a blacksmith to forge a special sword. A bard 
might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for an up- 
coming performance in front of the duke. 

Other hirelings provide more expert or dangerous 
services. Mercenary soldiers paid to help the adventur- 
ers take on a hobgoblin army are hirelings, as are sages 
hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level 
adventurer establishes a stronghold of some kind, he or 
she might hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run 
the place, from a castellan or steward to menial laborers 
to keep the stables clean. These hirelings often enjoy a 


CHAPTER 5: EQUIPMENT 





2d to print and photocopy this document for personal use or 





long-term contract that includes a place to live within the 
stronghold as part of the offered compensation. 


SERVICES 

Service Pay 

Coach cab 
Between towns 3 cp per mile 
Within a city lcp 

Hireling 
Skilled 2 gp per day 
Untrained 2 sp per day 

Messenger 2 cp per mile 

Road or gate toll lcp 

Ship’s passage 1 sp per mile 


Skilled hirelings include anyone hired to perform a 
service that involves a proficiency (including weapon, 
tool, or skill): a mercenary, artisan, scribe, and so on. The 
pay shown is a minimum; some expert hirelings require 
more pay. Untrained hirelings are hired for menial work 
that requires no particular skill and can include laborers, 
porters, maids, and similar workers. 


SPELLCASTING SERVICES 


People who are able to cast spells don’t fall into the cat- 
egory of ordinary hirelings. It might be possible to find 

someone willing to cast a spell in exchange for coin or 

favors, but it is rarely easy and no established pay rates 
exist. As a rule, the higher the level of the desired spell, 
the harder it is to find someone who can cast it and the 
more it costs. 

Hiring someone to cast a relatively common spell of 
1st or 2nd level, such as cure wounds or identify, is easy 
enough in a city or town, and might cost 10 to 50 gold 
pieces (plus the cost of any expensive material com- 
ponents). Finding someone able and willing to cast a 
higher-level spell might involve traveling to a large city, 
perhaps one with a university or prominent temple. Once 
found, the spellcaster might ask for a service instead of 
payment—the kind of service that only adventurers can 
provide, such as retrieving a rare item from a dangerous 
locale or traversing a monster-infested wilderness to de- 
liver something important to a distant settlement. 


tL , 
SELF-SUFFICIENCY 
The expenses and lifestyles described in this chapter 
assume that you are spending your time between 
adventures in town, availing yourself of whatever services 
you can afford—paying for food and shelter, paying 
townspeople to sharpen your sword and repair your armor, 
and so on. Some characters, though, might prefer to spend 
their time away from civilization, sustaining themselves in 
the wild by hunting, foraging, and repairing their own gear. 
Maintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn’t require you to 
spend any coin, but it is time-consuming. If you spend 
your time between adventures practicing a profession, as 
described in chapter 8, you can eke out the equivalent of a 
poor lifestyle. Proficiency in the Survival skill lets you live at 
the equivalent of a comfortable lifestyle.

‘TRINKETS 


When you make your character, you can roll once on 
the Trinkets table to gain a trinket, a simple item lightly 
touched by mystery. The DM might also use this table. 
It can help stock a room in a dungeon or fill a crea- 
ture’s pockets.

CHAPTER 6: CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS 


THE COMBINATION OF ABILITY SCORES, RACE, CLASS, and 
background defines your character’s capabilities in the 
game, and the personal details you create set your char- 
acter apart from every other character. Even within your 
class and race, you have options to fine-tune what your 
character can do. But a few players—with the DM’s per- 
mission—want to go a step further. 

Chapter 6 of the Player's Handbook defines two 
optional sets of rules for customizing your character: 
multiclassing and feats. Multiclassing lets you combine 
classes together, and feats are special options you can 
choose instead of increasing your ability scores as you 
gain levels. Your DM decides whether these options are 
available in a campaign. 


MULTICLASSING 


Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple 
classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those 
classes to realize a character concept that might not be 
reflected in one of the standard class options. 

With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level 
in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead 
of gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in all 
your classes are added together to determine your char- 
acter level. For example, if you have three levels in wizard 
and two in fighter, you’re a 5th-level character. 

As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain 
a member of your original class with just a few levels in 
another class, or you might change course entirely, never 
looking back at the class you left behind. You might even 
start progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to 
a single-class character of the same level, you'll sacrifice 
some focus in exchange for versatility. 


PREREQUISITES 


To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score 
prerequisites for both your current class and your new 
one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table 
in the Player’s Handbook. Without the full training that 
a beginning character receives, you must be a quick 
study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that 

is reflected by higher-than-average ability scores. 


EXPERIENCE POINTS 


The experience point cost to gain a level is always based 


on your total character level, as shown in the Character 
Advancement table in chapter 1 of this document, not 
your level in a particular class. 


HIT POINTS AND HIT DICE 


You gain the hit points from your new class as described 


for levels after 1st. You gain the 1st-level hit points for a 
class only when you are a 1st-level character. 

You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your 
classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are 
the same die type, you can simply pool them together. 
If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep 
track of them separately. 


PROFICIENCY BONUS 


Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total 
character level, as shown in the Character Advancement 
table, not your level in a particular class. 


PROFICIENCIES 


When you gain a level in a class other than your first, you 


gain only some of that class’s starting proficiencies. See 


chapter 6 of the Player's Handbook for more information. 


CLASS FEATURES 


When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features 


for that level. A few features, however, have additional 
rules when you're multiclassing. See chapter 6 of the 
Player's Handbook for more information. 


FEATS 


A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives 
a character special capabilities. It embodies training, ex- 
perience, and abilities beyond what a class provides. See 


chapter 6 of the Player’s Handbook for more information. 


At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score 
Improvement feature. Using the optional feats rule, you 
can forgo taking that feature to take a feat of your choice 
instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the 
feat’s description says otherwise. 

You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to 
take that feat. If you ever lose a feat’s prerequisite, you 
can't use that feat until you regain the prerequisite.

CHAPTER 7: USING ABILITY SCORES 


SIX ABILITIES PROVIDE A QUICK DESCRIPTION OF EVERY 
creature’s physical and mental characteristics: 


Strength, measuring physical power 

Dexterity, measuring agility 

Constitution, measuring endurance 
Intelligence, measuring reasoning and memory 
Wisdom, measuring perception and insight 
Charisma, measuring force of personality 


Is a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and 
charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these 
qualities—a creature’s assets as well as weaknesses. 

The three main rolls of the game—the ability check, the 
saving throw, and the attack roll—rely on the six ability 
scores. The book’s introduction describes the basic rule 
behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier de- 
rived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the 
total to a target number. 

This chapter focuses on how to use ability checks and 
saving throws, covering the fundamental activities that 
creatures attempt in the game. Rules for attack rolls ap- 
pear in chapter 9. 


ABILITY SCORES AND 
MODIFIERS 


Each of a creature’s abilities has a score, a number that 
defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is 
not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encom- 
passes a creature’s training and competence in activities 
related to that ability. 

Ascore of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but 
adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average 
in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a per- 
son usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high 
as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as 
high as 30. 

Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score 
and ranging from -5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for 
ascore of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table 
notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability 
scores, from 1 to 30. 

To determine an ability modifier without consulting the 
table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide 
the total by 2 (round down). 


ABILITY SCORES AND MODIFIERS 


Score Modifier Score Modifier 
1 -5 16-17 +3 
2-3 -4 18-19 +4 
4-5 -3 20-21 +5 
6-7 -2 22-23 +6 
8-9 -1 24-25 +7 
10-11 +0 26-27 +8 
12-13 +1 28-29 +9 
14-15 +2 30 +10 


Because ability modifiers affect almost every attack 
roll, ability check, and saving throw, ability modifiers 
come up in play more often than their associated scores. 


ADVANTAGE AND 
DISADVANTAGE 


Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you 
have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a 
saving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens, you 
roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher 
of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower 
roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have 
disadvantage and roll a 17 anda 5, you use the 5. If you 
instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you 

use the 17. 

If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants 
advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don’t roll 
more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations 
grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one addi- 
tional d20. 

If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage 
and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of 
them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple 
circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants 
advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have nei- 
ther advantage nor disadvantage. 

When you have advantage or disadvantage and some- 
thing in the game, such as the halfling’s Lucky trait, lets 
you reroll or replace the d20, you can reroll or replace 
only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, 
if a halfling has advantage or disadvantage on an ability 
check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the 
Lucky trait to reroll the 1. 

You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through 
the use of special abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration 
can also give a character advantage (as explained in 
chapter 4, “Personality and Background”). The DM can 
also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one 
direction or the other and grant advantage or impose dis- 
advantage as a result. 


PROFICIENCY BONUS 


Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by level, 
as detailed in chapter 1. Monsters also have this bonus, 
which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus is 
used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and 
attack rolls. 

Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die 
roll or other number more than once. For example, if two 
different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to 
a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus 
only once when you make the save. 

Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multi- 
plied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before 
you apply it. For example, the rogue’s Expertise feature 
doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks. 
If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus 


CHAPTER 7: USING ABILITY SCORES 





D&amp;D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and f 





py this document for personal use only 








applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it 
only once and multiply or divide it only once. 

By the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to 
multiply your proficiency bonus when making an ability 
check that wouldn’t normally benefit from your profi- 
ciency bonus, you still don’t add the bonus to the check. 
For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact 
that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if 
you lack proficiency in the History skill, you gain no ben- 
efit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency 
bonus when you make Intelligence (History) checks. 

In general, you don’t multiply your proficiency bonus for 
attack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows 
you to do so, these same rules apply. 


ABILITY CHECKS 


An ability check tests a character’s or monster’s innate 
talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. 
The DM calls for an ability check when a character or 
monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that 
has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, 
the dice determine the results. 

For every ability check, the DM decides which of the six 
abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty 
of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class. The more 
difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty 
Classes table shows the most common DCs. 


TyPICAL DIFFICULTY CLASSES 


Task Difficulty DC 
Very easy 5 

Easy 10 
Medium 15 
Hard 20 
Very hard 25 
Nearly impossible 30 


To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the rel- 
evant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply 
bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. 
If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check 
is a success—the creature overcomes the challenge at 
hand. Otherwise, it’s a failure, which means the charac- 
ter or monster makes no progress toward the objective 
or makes progress combined with a setback determined 
by the DM. 


CONTESTS 


Sometimes one character’s or monster’s efforts are di- 
rectly opposed to another’s. This can occur when both 
of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can 
succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring 
that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies 
when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from 
accomplishing a goal—for example, when a monster tries 
to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. 
In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a 
special form of ability check, called a contest. 

Both participants in a contest make ability checks 
appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate 
bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total 


to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The 
participant with the higher check total wins the contest. 
That character or monster either succeeds at the action 
or prevents the other one from succeeding. 

If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the 
same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant 
might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in 
a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character 
grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open 
a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, 
a tie means that the door remains shut. 


SKILLS 


Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, includ- 


ing skills that a character or a monster can be proficient 
in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, 
and an individual’s proficiency in a skill demonstrates 

a focus on that aspect. (A character’s starting skill pro- 
ficiencies are determined at character creation, anda 
monster’s skill proficiencies appear in the monster’s 

stat block.) 

For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a char- 
acter’s attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an 
object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexter- 
ity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, 
and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has profi- 
ciency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity 
checks related to sneaking and hiding. 

The skills related to each ability score are shown in 
the following list. (No skills are related to Constitution.) 
See an ability’s description in the later sections of this 
chapter for examples of how to use a skill associated 
with an ability. 


Strength Wisdom 
Athletics Animal Handling 
Dexterity Insight 
Acrobatics Medicine 
Sleight of Hand Perception 
Stealth Survival 
Intelligence Charisma 
Arcana Deception 
Histor Intimidation 

y 
Investigation Performance 
Nature Persuasion 
Religion 


Sometimes, the DM might ask for an ability check 
using a specific skill—for example, “Make a Wisdom (Per- 
ception) check.” At other times, a player might ask the 
DM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. 
In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual 
can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that 
involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the indi- 
vidual makes a normal ability check. 

For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dan- 
gerous cliff, the Dungeon Master might ask for a Strength 
(Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Ath- 
letics, the character’s proficiency bonus is added to the 
Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he 
or she just makes a Strength check.

VARIANT: SKILLS WITH DIFFERENT ABILITIES 
Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a 
specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics, 
for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some 
situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably 
apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the DM 
might ask for a check using an unusual combination of 
ability and skill, or you might ask your DM if you can ap- 
ply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you 
have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, 
your DM might call for a Constitution check to see if you 
have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your 
DM might allow you to apply your proficiency in Athletics 
and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check. So if you’re 
proficient in Athletics, you apply your proficiency bonus to 
the Constitution check just as you would normally do for 
a Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, when your dwarf 
fighter uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an 
enemy, your DM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) 
check, even though Intimidation is normally associated 
with Charisma. 


PASSIVE CHECKS 


A passive check is a special kind of ability check that 
doesn’t involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent 
the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as 
searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be 
used when the DM wants to secretly determine whether 
the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, 
such as noticing a hidden monster. 

Here’s how to determine a character’s total for a pas- 
sive check: 


10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check 


If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For 
disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive 
check total as a score. 

For example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 
15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive 
Wisdom (Perception) score of 14. 

The rules on hiding in the “Dexterity” section below 
rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules in 
chapter 8. 


WORKING TOGETHER 


Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a 
task. The character who's leading the effort—or the one 
with the highest ability modifier—can make an ability 
check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the 
other characters. In combat, this requires the Help action 
(see chapter 9). 

Acharacter can only provide help if the task is one that 
he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open 
a lock requires proficiency with thieves’ tools, so a charac- 
ter who lacks that proficiency can’t help another character 
in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two 
or more individuals working together would actually be 
productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no 
easier with help. 


Group CHECKS 

When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish 
something as a group, the DM might ask for a group 
ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are 
skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren't. 

To make a group ability check, everyone in the group 
makes the ability check. If at least half the group 
succeeds, the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the 
group fails. 

Group checks don’t come up very often, and they’re 
most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a 
group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a 
swamp, the DM might call for a group Wisdom (Survival) 
check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, 
sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. 
If at least half the group succeeds, the successful char- 
acters are able to guide their companions out of danger. 
Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards. 


UsING EACH ABILITY 


Every task that a character or monster might attempt 

in the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This 
section explains in more detail what those abilities mean 
and the ways they are used in the game. 


STRENGTH 


Strength measures bodily power, athletic training, and 
the extent to which you can exert raw physical force. 


STRENGTH CHECKS 

A Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, 
pull, or break something, to force your body through a 
space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. 
The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of 
Strength checks. 

Athletics. Your Strength (Athletics) check covers 
difficult situations you encounter while climbing, 
jumping, or swimming. Examples include the 
following activities: 


« You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid 
hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while 
something is trying to knock you off. 

« You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull 

off a stunt midjump. 

You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous cur- 

rents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. 

Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwa- 

ter or otherwise interfere with your swimming. 


Other Strength Checks. The DM might also call for 
a Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like 
the following: 


« Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door 

- Break free of bonds 

- Push through a tunnel that is too small 

- Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it 
« Tip over a statue 

« Keep a boulder from rolling 


CHAPTER 7: USING ABILITY SCORES 








D&amp;D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission grantec 


to print and photocopy this document for personal use only 





ATTACK ROLLS AND DAMAGE 

You add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and 
your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon 
such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use me- 
lee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand 
combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a 
ranged attack. 


LIFTING AND CARRYING 

Your Strength score determines the amount of weight 
you can bear. The following terms define what you can 
lift or carry. 

Carrying Capacity. Your carrying capacity is your 
Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in 
pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that 
most characters don’t usually have to worry about it. 

Push, Drag, or Lift. You can push, drag, or lift a weight 
in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times 
your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight 
in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops 
to 5 feet. 

Size and Strength. Larger creatures can bear more 
weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each 
size category above Medium, double the creature’s carry- 
ing capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For 
a Tiny creature, halve these weights. 


VARIANT: ENCUMBRANCE 

The rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally sim- 
ple. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed 
rules for determining how a character is hindered by the 
weight of equipment. When you use this variant, ignore 
the Strength column of the Armor table in chapter 5. 

If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength 
score, you are encumbered, which means your speed 
drops by 10 feet. 

If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength 
score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are 
instead heavily encumbered, which means your speed 
drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability 
checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, 
Dexterity, or Constitution. 


DEXTERITY 


Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance. 


DEXTERITY CHECKS 

A Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, 
quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky foot- 
ing. The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills 
reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks. 

Acrobatics. Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers 
your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such 
as when you're trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance 
on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship’s deck. 
The DM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check 
to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including 
dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips. 

Sleight of Hand. Whenever you attempt an act of leger- 
demain or manual trickery, such as planting something 
on someone else or concealing an object on your per- 
son, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The DM 
might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to 


-d to print and photocopy this document for personal use or 


PS sh!!! EE! Gm ™ 
HIDING 
The DM decides when circumstances are appropriate for 
hiding. When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) 
check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that 
check’s total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) 
check of any creature that actively searches for signs of 
your presence. 

You can’t hide from a creature that can see you clearly, 
and you give away your position if you make noise, such as 
shouting a warning or knocking over a vase. An invisible 
creature can’t be seen, so it can always try to hide. Signs of 
its passage might still be noticed, however, and it still has 
to stay quiet. 

In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger 
all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach 
a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain 
circumstances, the Dungeon Master might allow you to 
stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, 
allowing you to gain advantage on an attack before 
you are seen. 

Passive Perception. When you hide, there’s a chance 
someone will notice you even if they aren’t searching. To 
determine whether such a creature notices you, the DM 
compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature’s 
passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the 
creature’s Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses 
or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For 
disadvantage, subtract 5. 

For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency 
bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and 
proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom 
(Perception) of 14. 

What Can You See? One of the main factors in 
determining whether you can find a hidden creature or 
object is how well you can see in an area, which might be 
lightly or heavily obscured, as explained in chapter 8. 

de 


determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another 
person or slip something out of another 
person’s pocket. 

Stealth. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you 
attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past 
guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on 
someone without being seen or heard. 

Other Dexterity Checks. The DM might call for a 
Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like 
the following: 


« Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent 
« Steer a chariot around a tight turn 

« Pick a lock 

« Disable a trap 

- Securely tie up a prisoner 

- Wriggle free of bonds 

- Playa stringed instrument 

« Craft a small or detailed object 


ATTACK ROLLS AND DAMAGE 

You add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and 
your damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon, 
such as a sling or a longbow. You can also add your Dex- 
terity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll 
when attacking with a melee weapon that has the finesse 
property, such as a dagger or a rapier. 


CHAPTER 7: USING ABILITY SCORES 6 
Seta ——__ 63 








ARMOR CLASS 

Depending on the armor you wear, you might add some 
or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, 
as described in chapter 5. 


INITIATIVE 

At the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by 
making a Dexterity check. Initiative determines the order 
of creatures’ turns in combat, as described in chapter 9. 


CONSTITUTION 


Constitution measures health, stamina, and vital force. 


CONSTITUTION CHECKS 
Constitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply 
to Constitution checks, because the endurance this abil- 
ity represents is largely passive rather than involving a 
specific effort on the part of a character or monster. A 
Constitution check can model your attempt to push be- 
yond normal limits, however. 

The DM might call for a Constitution check when you 
try to accomplish tasks like the following: 


¢ Hold your breath 

« March or labor for hours without rest 
¢ Go without sleep 

¢ Survive without food or water 

¢ Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go 


HiT PoINnTs 

Your Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points. 
Typically, you add your Constitution modifier to each Hit 
Die you roll for your hit points. 

If your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point 
maximum changes as well, as though you had the new 
modifier from 1st level. For example, if you raise your 
Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your 
Constitution modifier increases from +1 to +2, you ad- 
just your hit point maximum as though the modifier had 
always been +2. So you add 3 hit points for your first 
three levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th level 
using your new modifier. Or if you’re 7th level and some 
effect lowers your Constitution score so as to reduce your 
Constitution modifier by 1, your hit point maximum is 
reduced by 7. 


INTELLIGENCE 


Intelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, 
and the ability to reason. 


INTELLIGENCE CHECKS 

An Intelligence check comes into play when you need 

to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive rea- 
soning. The Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, and 
Religion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelli- 
gence checks. 

Arcana. Your Intelligence (Arcana) check measures 
your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, 
eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of exis- 
tence, and the inhabitants of those planes. 

History. Your Intelligence (History) check mea- 
sures your ability to recall lore about historical events, 


legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, re- 
cent wars, and lost civilizations. 

Investigation. When you look around for clues and 
make deductions based on those clues, you make an 
Intelligence (Investigation) check. You might deduce the 
location of a hidden object, discern from the appearance 
of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the 
weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. 
Poring through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden 
fragment of knowledge might also call for an Intelligence 
(Investigation) check. 

Nature. Your Intelligence (Nature) check measures 
your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and ani- 
mals, the weather, and natural cycles. 

Religion. Your Intelligence (Religion) check measures 
your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, 
religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices 
of secret cults. 

Other Intelligence Checks. The DM might call for an 
Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like 
the following: 


- Communicate with a creature without using words 
« Estimate the value of a precious item 

- Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard 

« Forge a document 

¢ Recall lore about a craft or trade 

- Win a game of skill 


SPELLCASTING ABILITY 

Wizards use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability, 
which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells 
they cast. 


WISDOM 


Wisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around 
you and represents perceptiveness and intuition. 


WISDOM CHECKS 
A Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body 
language, understand someone’s feelings, notice things 
about the environment, or care for an injured person. 
The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and 
Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wis- 
dom checks. 

Animal Handling. When there is any question whether 
you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount 


te, 
FINDING A HIDDEN OBJECT 
When your character searches for a hidden object such as 
a secret door or a trap, the DM typically asks you to make 
a Wisdom (Perception) check. Such a check can be used to 
find hidden details or other information and clues that you 
might otherwise overlook. 
In most cases, you need to describe where you are looking 
in order for the DM to determine your chance of success. 
For example, a key is hidden beneath a set of folded clothes 
in the top drawer of a bureau. If you tell the DM that you 
pace around the room, looking at the walls and furniture for 
clues, you have no chance of finding the key, regardless of 
your Wisdom (Perception) check result. You would have to 
specify that you were opening the drawers or searching the 
bureau in order to have any chance of success.

from getting spooked, or intuit an animal’s intentions, the 
DM might call for a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. 
You also make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to con- 
trol your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver. 

Insight. Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether 
you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such 
as when searching out a lie or predicting someone’s next 
move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body lan- 
guage, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms. 

Medicine. A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to 
stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness. 

Perception. Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you 
spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. 
It measures your general awareness of 
your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. 

For example, you might try to hear a conversation through 
a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear 
monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try 
to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether 
they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in 
the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed 
secret door. 

Survival. The DM might ask you to make a Wisdom 
(Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide 
your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that 
owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quick- 
sand and other natural hazards. 

Other Wisdom Checks. The DM might call for a 
Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like 
the following: 


« Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow 
« Discern whether a seemingly dead or living crea- 
ture is undead 


SPELLCASTING ABILITY 
Clerics use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which 
helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast. 


CHARISMA 


Charisma measures your ability to interact effectively 
with others. It includes such factors as confidence and 
eloquence, and it can represent a charming or command- 
ing personality. 


CHARISMA CHECKS 

A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence 
or entertain others, when you try to make an impres- 
sion or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating 
a tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, 
Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in 
certain kinds of Charisma checks. 

Deception. Your Charisma (Deception) check deter- 
mines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either 
verbally or through your actions. This deception can 
encompass everything from misleading others through 
ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations in- 
clude trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn 
money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, 
dull someone’s suspicions with false assurances, or main- 
tain a straight face while telling a blatant lie. 

Intimidation. When you attempt to influence some- 
one through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical 


violence, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma 
(Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry in- 
formation out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs 

to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of 
a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to recon- 
sider a decision. 

Performance. Your Charisma (Performance) check 
determines how well you can delight an audience with 
music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of 
entertainment. 

Persuasion. When you attempt to influence someone 
or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good 
nature, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma 
(Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when 
acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial 
requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of per- 
suading others include convincing a chamberlain to let 
your party see the king, negotiating peace between war- 
ring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk. 

Other Charisma Checks. The DM might call for a 
Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like 
the following: 


- Find the best person to talk to for news, 
rumors, and gossip 

« Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics 
of conversation 


SPELLCASTING ABILITY 

Bards, paladins, sorcerers, and warlocks use Charisma 
as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the 
saving throw DCs of spells they cast. 


SAVING THROWS 


A saving throw—also called a save—represents an at- 
tempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or 

a similar threat. You don’t normally decide to make a 
saving throw; you are forced to make one because your 
character or monster is at risk of harm. 

To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the ap- 
propriate ability modifier. For example, you use your 
Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw. 

A saving throw can be modified by a situational 
bonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage 
and disadvantage, as determined by the DM. 

Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving 
throws. The wizard, for example, is proficient in Intelli- 
gence saves. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a 
saving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency bo- 
nus to saving throws made using a particular ability score. 
Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well. 

The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by 
the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving 
throw allowed by a spell is determined by the caster’s 
spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus. 

The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also 
detailed in the effect that allows the save. Usually, a suc- 
cessful save means that a creature suffers no harm, or 
reduced harm, from an effect.

CHAPTER 8: ADVENTURING 


DELVING INTO THE ANCIENT TOMB OF HORRORS, SLIPPING 
through the back alleys of Waterdeep, hacking a fresh 
trail through the thick jungles on the Isle of Dread—these 
are the things that DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS adventures 
are made of. Your character in the game might explore 
forgotten ruins and uncharted lands, uncover dark se- 
crets and sinister plots, and slay foul monsters. And if 

all goes well, your character will survive to claim rich 
rewards before embarking on a new adventure. 

This chapter covers the basics of the adventuring life, 
from the mechanics of movement to the complexities of 
social interaction. The rules for resting are also in this 
chapter, along with a discussion of the activities your 
character might pursue between adventures. 

Whether adventurers are exploring a dusty dungeon 
or the complex relationships of a royal court, the game 
follows a natural rhythm, as outlined in the book’s 
introduction: 


1. The DM describes the environment. 
2. The players describe what they want to do. 
3. The DM narrates the results of their actions. 


Typically, the DM uses a map as an outline of the adven- 
ture, tracking the characters’ progress as they explore 
dungeon corridors or wilderness regions. The DM’s 
notes, including a key to the map, describe what the ad- 
venturers find as they enter each new area. Sometimes, 
the passage of time and the adventurers’ actions deter- 
mine what happens, so the DM might use a timeline or a 
flowchart to track their progress instead of a map. 


TIME 


In situations where keeping track of the passage of time 


is important, the DM determines the time a task requires. 


The DM might use a different time scale depending on 
the context of the situation at hand. In a dungeon envi- 
ronment, the adventurers’ movement happens ona scale 
of minutes. It takes them about a minute to creep down 
a long hallway, another minute to check for traps on 

the door at the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes 

to search the chamber beyond for anything interesting 
or valuable. 

In a city or wilderness, a scale of hours is often more 
appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower 
at the heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles 
in just under four hours’ time. 

For long journeys, a scale of days works best. Fol- 
lowing the road from Baldur’s Gate to Waterdeep, the 
adventurers spend four uneventful days before a goblin 
ambush interrupts their journey. 

In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game 
relies on rounds, a 6-second span of time described in 
chapter 9. 


MOvEMENT 


Swimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dun- 
geon corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain slope—all 
sorts of movement play a key role in D&amp;D adventures. 

The DM can summarize the adventurers’ movement 
without calculating exact distances or travel times: “You 
travel through the forest and find the dungeon entrance 
late in the evening of the third day.” Even in a dungeon, 
particularly a large dungeon or a cave network, the DM 
can summarize movement between encounters: “After 
killing the guardian at the entrance to the ancient dwar- 
ven stronghold, you consult your map, which leads you 
through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by 
a narrow stone arch.” 

Sometimes it’s important, though, to know how long it 
takes to get from one spot to another, whether the answer 
is in days, hours, or minutes. The rules for determining 
travel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel 
pace of the creatures moving and the terrain they’re 
moving over. 


SPEED 


Every character and monster has a speed, which is the 

distance in feet that the character or monster can walk in 

1 round. This number assumes short bursts of energetic 

movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation. 
The following rules determine how far a character 

or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day. 


TRAVEL PACE 

While traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a 
normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace 
table. The table states how far the party can move ina 
period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast 
pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace 
makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area 
more carefully (see the “Activity While Traveling” section 
later in this chapter for more information). 

Forced March. The Travel Pace table assumes that 
characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on be- 
yond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion. 

For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, 
the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour 
column for their pace, and each character must make a 
Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC 
is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving 
throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion (see 
appendix A). 

Mounts and Vehicles. For short spans of time (up to an 
hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. 
A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an 
hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If 
fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters 
can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very 
rare except in densely populated areas. 

Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles 
choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne 
vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel (See chapter 


CHAPTER 8: ADVENTURING 





D&amp;D Basic Rules 


Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission gr

5), and they don’t suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain 
benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and 
the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 
24 hours per day. 

Certain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, 
or special vehicles, such as a carpet of flying, allow you 
to travel more swiftly. The Dungeon Master’s Guide con- 
tains more information on special methods of travel. 


TRAVEL PACE 
Distance Traveled per... 


Pace Minute Hour Day Effect 

Fast 400 feet 4 miles 30 miles -5 penalty to 
passive Wisdom 
(Perception) scores 

Normal 300feet 3 miles 24 miles — 

Slow 200 feet 2miles 18 miles Able to use stealth 


DIFFICULT TERRAIN 
The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume 
relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dun- 
geon corridors. But adventurers often face dense forests, 
deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains, and 
ice-covered ground—all considered difficult terrain. 

You move at half speed in difficult terrain—moving 
1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed—so you 
can cover only half the normal distance in a minute, 
an hour, or a day. 


SPECIAL TYPES OF MOVEMENT 


Movement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness 
areas often involves more than simply walking. Adven- 
turers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get 
where they need to go. 


CLIMBING, SWIMMING, AND CRAWLING 

Each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet 

in difficult terrain) when you're climbing, swimming, or 
crawling. You ignore this extra cost if you have a climbing 
speed and use it to climb or a swimming speed and use it 
to swim. At the DM’s option, climbing a slippery vertical 
surface or one with few handholds requires a successful 
Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any dis- 
tance in rough water might require a successful Strength 
(Athletics) check. 


JUMPING 
Your Strength determines how far you can jump. 

Long Jump. When you make a long jump, you cover a 
number of feet up to your Strength score if you move at 
least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When 
you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half 
that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump 
costs a foot of movement. 

This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn’t 
matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At 
your DM’s option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength 
(Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a 
quarter of the jump’s distance), such as a hedge or low 
wall. Otherwise, you hit it. 


When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on 
a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. 
Otherwise, you land prone. 

High Jump. When you make a high jump, you leap 
into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength 
modifier (minimum of 0 feet) if you move at least 10 feet 
on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a 
standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance. 
Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of 
movement. In some circumstances, your DM might allow 
you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher 
than you normally can. 

You can extend your arms half your height above your- 
self during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a 
distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1% times 
your height. 


ACTIVITY WHILE TRAVELING 


As adventurers travel through a dungeon or the wil- 
derness, they need to remain alert for danger, and 
some characters might perform other tasks to help 
the group’s journey. 


MARCHING ORDER 

The adventurers should establish a marching order. A 
marching order makes it easier to determine which char- 
acters are affected by traps, which ones can spot hidden 
enemies, and which ones are the closest to those ene- 
mies when a fight breaks out. 

A character might occupy the front rank, one or more 
middle ranks, or the back rank. Characters in the front 
and back ranks need enough room to travel side by side 
with others in their rank. When space is too tight, the 
marching order must change, usually by moving charac- 
ters to a middle rank. 

Fewer Than Three Ranks. If an adventuring party 
arranges its marching order with only two ranks, they 
are a front rank and a back rank. If there’s only one rank, 
it’s considered a front rank. 


STEALTH 

While traveling at a slow pace, the characters can move 
stealthily. As long as they’re not in the open, they can try 
to surprise or sneak by other creatures they encounter. 
See the rules for hiding in chapter 7. 


i 
SPLITTING UP THE PARTY 
Sometimes, it makes sense to split an adventuring party, 
especially if you want one or more characters to scout 
ahead. You can form multiple parties, each moving at a 
different speed. Each group has its own front, middle, 
and back ranks. 

The drawback to this approach is that the party will be 
split into several smaller groups in the event of an attack. 
The advantage is that a small group of stealthy characters 
moving slowly might be able to sneak past enemies that 
clumsier characters would alert. A pair of rogues moving at 
a slow pace are much harder to detect when they leave their 
dwarf fighter friend behind.

CHAPTER 8: ADVENTURING 














NOTICING THREATS 

Use the passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of the char- 
acters to determine whether anyone in the group notices 
a hidden threat. The DM might decide that a threat can 
be noticed only by characters in a particular rank. For ex- 
ample, as the characters are exploring a maze of tunnels, 
the DM might decide that only those characters in the 
back rank have a chance to hear or spot a stealthy crea- 
ture following the group, while characters in the front 
and middle ranks cannot. 

While traveling at a fast pace, characters take a —5 
penalty to their passive Wisdom (Perception) scores 
to notice hidden threats. 

Encountering Creatures. If the DM determines that 
the adventurers encounter other creatures while they're 
traveling, it’s up to both groups to decide what happens 
next. Either group might decide to attack, initiate a 
conversation, run away, or wait to see what the other 
group does. 

Surprising Foes. If the adventurers encounter a hostile 
creature or group, the DM determines whether the ad- 
venturers or their foes might be surprised when combat 
erupts. See chapter 9 for more about surprise. 


OTHER ACTIVITIES 

Characters who turn their attention to other tasks as the 
group travels are not focused on watching for danger. 
These characters don’t contribute their passive Wisdom 
(Perception) scores to the group’s chance of noticing 
hidden threats. However, a character not watching for 
danger can do one of the following activities instead, or 
some other activity with the DM’s permission. 

Navigate. The character can try to prevent the group 
from becoming lost, making a Wisdom (Survival) check 
when the DM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master's Guide 
has rules to determine whether the group gets lost.) 

Draw a Map. The character can draw a map that 
records the group’s progress and helps the characters 
get back on course if they get lost. No ability check 
is required. 

Track. A character can follow the tracks of another 
creature, making a Wisdom (Survival) check when the 
DM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master's Guide has rules 
for tracking.) 

Forage. The character can keep an eye out for ready 
sources of food and water, making a Wisdom (Survival) 
check when the DM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master's 
Guide has rules for foraging.) 


THE ENVIRONMENT 


By its nature, adventuring involves delving into places 
that are dark, dangerous, and full of mysteries to be ex- 
plored. The rules in this section cover some of the most 
important ways in which adventurers interact with the en- 
vironment in such places. The Dungeon Master’s Guide 
has rules covering more unusual situations. 


FALLING 


A fall from a great height is one of the most common haz- 
ards facing an adventurer. 

At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning 
damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. 


The creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage 
from the fall. 


SUFFOCATING 


Acreature can hold its breath for a number of minutes 
equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 
30 seconds). 

When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can 
survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution 
modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next 
turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can’t re- 
gain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again. 

For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can 
hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 
2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points. 


VISION AND LIGHT 


The most fundamental tasks of adventuring—noticing 
danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in com- 
bat, and targeting a spell, to name just a few—rely heavily 
on a character’s ability to see. Darkness and other effects 
that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance. 

A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. Ina 
lightly obscured area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or 
moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wis- 
dom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. 

A heavily obscured area—such as darkness, opaque 
fog, or dense foliage—blocks vision entirely. A creature ef- 
fectively suffers from the blinded condition (Gee appendix 
A) when trying to see something in that area. 

The presence or absence of light in an environment 
creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim 
light, and darkness. 

Bright light lets most creatures see normally. Even 
gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, 
fires, and other sources of illumination within a spe- 
cific radius. 

Dim light, also called shadows, creates a lightly ob- 
scured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary 
between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and sur- 
rounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn 
also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon 
might bathe the land in dim light. 

Darkness creates a heavily obscured area. Charac- 
ters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit 
nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a sub- 
terranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness. 


BLINDSIGHT 

A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings 
without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Crea- 
tures without eyes, such as oozes, and creatures with 
echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true 
dragons, have this sense. 


DARKVISION 

Many creatures in the worlds of D&amp;D, especially those 
that dwell underground, have darkvision. Within a speci- 
fied range, a creature with darkvision can see in dim light 
as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim 
light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far 
as that creature is concerned. However, the creature can’t 
discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

‘TRUESIGHT 

A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, 
see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible 
creatures and objects, automatically detect visual il- 
lusions and succeed on saving throws against them, 
and perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a 
creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, 
the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane. 


FOOD AND WATER 


Characters who don’t eat or drink suffer the effects of 
exhaustion (see appendix A). Exhaustion caused by lack 
of food or water can’t be removed until the character eats 
and drinks the full required amount. 


Foop 

A character needs one pound of food per day and can 
make food last longer by subsisting on half rations. 
Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day 
without food. 

A character can go without food for a number of days 
equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum 
1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a character 
automatically suffers one level of exhaustion. 

A normal day of eating resets the count of days without 
food to zero. 


WATER 
A character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gal- 
lons per day if the weather is hot. A character who drinks 
only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Con- 
stitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at 
the end of the day. A character with access to even less 
water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the 
end of the day. 

If the character already has one or more levels of ex- 
haustion, the character takes two levels in either case. 


INTERACTING WITH OBJECTS 


A character’s interaction with objects in an environment 


is often simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the 
DM that his or her character is doing something, such 

as moving a lever, and the DM describes what, if any- 
thing, happens. 

For example, a character might decide to pull a lever, 
which might, in turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to 
flood with water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall. If 
the lever is rusted in position, though, a character might 
need to force it. In such a situation, the DM might call 
for a Strength check to see whether the character can 
wrench the lever into place. The DM sets the DC for any 
such check based on the difficulty of the task. 

Characters can also damage objects with their weap- 
ons and spells. Objects are immune to poison and 
psychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected by 
physical and magical attacks much like creatures can. 
The DM determines an object’s Armor Class and hit 
points, and might decide that certain objects have resis- 
tance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It’s hard 
to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects always 
fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are 


immune to effects that require other saves. When an ob- 
ject drops to 0 hit points, it breaks. 

A character can also attempt a Strength check to break 
an object. The DM sets the DC for any such check. 


SOCIAL INTERACTION 


Exploring dungeons, overcoming obstacles, and slay- 
ing monsters are key parts of D&amp;D adventures. No less 
important, though, are the social interactions that adven- 
turers have with other inhabitants of the world. 

Interaction takes on many forms. You might need to 
convince an unscrupulous thief to confess to some mal- 
feasance, or you might try to flatter a dragon so that it 
will spare your life. The DM assumes the roles of any 
characters who are participating in the interaction that 
don’t belong to another player at the table. Any such char- 
acter is called a nonplayer character (NPC). 

In general terms, an NPC’s attitude toward you is de- 
scribed as friendly, indifferent, or hostile. Friendly NPCs 
are predisposed to help you, and hostile ones are inclined 
to get in your way. It’s easier to get what you want froma 
friendly NPC, of course. 

Social interactions have two primary aspects: roleplay- 
ing and ability checks. 


ROLEPLAYING 


Roleplaying is, literally, the act of playing out a role. In 
this case, it’s you as a player determining how your char- 
acter thinks, acts, and talks. 

Roleplaying is a part of every aspect of the game, and it 
comes to the fore during social interactions. Your charac- 
ter’s quirks, mannerisms, and personality influence how 
interactions resolve. 

There are two styles you can use when roleplaying your 
character: the descriptive approach and the active ap- 
proach. Most players use a combination of the two styles. 
Use whichever mix of the two works best for you. 


DESCRIPTIVE APPROACH TO ROLEPLAYING 

With this approach, you describe your character’s words 
and actions to the DM and the other players. Drawing on 
your mental image of your character, you tell everyone 
what your character does and how he or she does it. 

For instance, Chris plays Tordek the dwarf. Tordek has 
a quick temper and blames the elves of the Cloakwood 
for his family’s misfortune. At a tavern, an obnoxious elf 
minstrel sits at Tordek’s table and tries to strike up a con- 
versation with the dwarf. 

Chris says, “Tordek spits on the floor, growls an insult 
at the bard, and stomps over to the bar. He sits on a stool 
and glares at the minstrel before ordering another drink.” 

In this example, Chris has conveyed Tordek’s mood 
and given the DM aclear idea of his character’s attitude 
and actions. 

When using descriptive roleplaying, keep the following 
things in mind: 


« Describe your character’s emotions and attitude. 

« Focus on your character’s intent and how others 
might perceive it. 

« Provide as much embellishment as you feel 
comfortable with.

Don’t worry about getting things exactly right. Just fo- 
cus on thinking about what your character would do and 
describing what you see in your mind. 


ACTIVE APPROACH TO ROLEPLAYING 

If descriptive roleplaying tells your DM and your fellow 
players what your character thinks and does, active role- 
playing shows them. 

When you use active roleplaying, you speak with your 
character’s voice, like an actor taking on a role. You might 
even echo your character’s movements and body language. 
This approach is more immersive than descriptive role- 
playing, though you still need to describe things that 
can’t be reasonably acted out. 

Going back to the example of Chris roleplaying Tordek 
above, here’s how the scene might play out if Chris used 
active roleplaying: 

Speaking as Tordek, Chris says in a gruff, deep voice, 
“T was wondering why it suddenly smelled awful in here. 
If I wanted to hear anything out of you, I’d snap your arm 
and enjoy your screams.” In his normal voice, Chris then 
adds, “I get up, glare at the elf, and head to the bar.” 


RESULTS OF ROLEPLAYING 

The DM uses your character’s actions and attitudes to 
determine how an NPC reacts. A cowardly NPC buckles 
under threats of violence. A stubborn dwarf refuses to let 
anyone badger her. A vain dragon laps up flattery. 

When interacting with an NPC, pay close attention to 
the DM’s portrayal of the NPC’s mood, dialogue, and 
personality. You might be able to determine an NPC’s 
personality traits, ideals, flaws, and bonds, then play on 
them to influence the NPC’s attitude. 

Interactions in D&amp;D are much like interactions in real 
life. If you can offer NPCs something they want, threaten 
them with something they fear, or play on their sympa- 
thies and goals, you can use words to get almost anything 
you want. On the other hand, if you insult a proud warrior 
or speak ill of a noble’s allies, your efforts to convince or 
deceive will fall short. 


ABILITY CHECKS 


In addition to roleplaying, ability checks are key in deter- 
mining the outcome of an interaction. 

Your roleplaying efforts can alter an NPC’s attitude, but 
there might still be an element of chance in the situation. 
For example, your DM can call for a Charisma check at 
any point during an interaction if he or she wants the dice 
to play a role in determining an NPC’s reactions. Other 
checks might be appropriate in certain situations, at your 
DM’s discretion. 

Pay attention to your skill proficiencies when thinking 
of how you want to interact with an NPC, and stack the 
deck in your favor by using an approach that relies on 
your best bonuses and skills. If the group needs to trick a 
guard into letting them into a castle, the rogue who is pro- 
ficient in Deception is the best bet to lead the discussion. 
When negotiating for a hostage’s release, the cleric with 
Persuasion should do most of the talking. 


RESTING 


Heroic though they might be, adventurers can’t spend 
every hour of the day in the thick of exploration, social in- 
teraction, and combat. They need rest—time to sleep and 
eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits for 
spellcasting, and brace themselves for further adventure. 

Adventurers, as well as other creatures, can take short 
rests in the midst of a day and a long rest to end it. 


SHORT REST 


A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, 
during which a character does nothing more strenuous 
than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds. 

A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end 
of a short rest, up to the character’s maximum number of 
Hit Dice, which is equal to the character’s level. For each 
Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds 
the character’s Constitution modifier to it. The character 
regains hit points equal to the total (minimum of 0). The 
player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after 
each roll. A character regains some spent Hit Dice upon 
finishing a long rest, as explained below. 


LONG REST 


A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 
hours long, during which a character sleeps for at least 
6 hours and performs no more than 2 hours of light ac- 
tivity, such as reading, talking, eating, or standing watch. 
If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activ- 
ity—at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or 
similar adventuring activity—the characters must begin 
the rest again to gain any benefit from it. 

At the end ofa long rest, a character regains all lost 
hit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up 
to a number of dice equal to half of the character’s total 
number of them (minimum of one die). For example, if a 
character has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four 
spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest. 

A character can’t benefit from more than one long rest 
in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 
1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits. 


BETWEEN ADVENTURES 


Between trips to dungeons and battles against ancient 
evils, adventurers need time to rest, recuperate, and 
prepare for their next adventure. Many adventurers also 
use this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting 
arms and armor, performing research, or spending 
their hard-earned gold. 

In some cases, the passage of time is something that 
occurs with little fanfare or description. When starting a 
new adventure, the DM might simply declare that a cer- 
tain amount of time has passed and allow you to describe 
in general terms what your character has 
been doing. At other times, the DM might want to keep 
track of just how much time is passing as events beyond 
your perception stay in motion.

LIFESTYLE EXPENSES 


Between adventures, you choose a particular quality of 
life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle, as de- 
scribed in chapter 5. 

Living a particular lifestyle doesn’t have a huge effect 
on your character, but your lifestyle can affect the way 
other individuals and groups react to you. For example, 
when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier 
for you to influence the nobles of the city than if you live 
in poverty. 


DOWNTIME ACTIVITIES 


Between adventures, the DM might ask you what your 
character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods 
of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime 
activity requires a certain number of days to complete 
before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each 
day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day 
to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you 
have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, 
you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period 
of time, or switch to a new downtime activity. 

Downtime activities other than the ones presented be- 
low are possible. If you want your character to spend his 
or her downtime performing an activity not covered here, 
discuss it with your DM. 


CRAFTING 

You can craft nonmagical objects, including adventur- 
ing equipment and works of art. You must be proficient 
with tools related to the object you are trying to create 
(typically artisan’s tools). You might also need access to 
special materials or locations necessary to create it. For 
example, someone proficient with smith’s tools needs a 
forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor. 

For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can 
craft one or more items with a total market value not ex- 
ceeding 5 gp, and you must expend raw materials worth 
half the total market value. If something you want to craft 
has a market value greater than 5 gp, you make progress 
every day in 5-gp increments until you reach the market 
value of the item. For example, a suit of plate armor (mar- 
ket value 1,500 gp) takes 300 days to craft by yourself. 

Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward 
the crafting of a single item, provided that the charac- 
ters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are 
working together in the same place. Each character con- 
tributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent helping to 
craft the item. For example, three characters with the req- 
uisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a 
suit of plate armor in 100 days, at a total cost of 750 gp. 

While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle 
without having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable 
lifestyle at half the normal cost (see chapter 5 for more 
information on lifestyle expenses). 


PRACTICING A PROFESSION 

You can work between adventures, allowing you to main- 
tain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day 
(see chapter 5 for more information on lifestyle expenses). 
This benefit lasts as long you continue to practice your 
profession. 


If you are a member of an organization that can pro- 
vide gainful employment, such as a temple or a thieves’ 
guild, you earn enough to support a comfortable life- 
style instead. 

If you have proficiency in the Performance skill and put 
your performance skill to use during your downtime, you 
earn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead. 


RECUPERATING 
You can use downtime between adventures to recover 
from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison. 

After three days of downtime spent recuperating, 
you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. 
On a successful save, you can choose one of the 
following results: 


« End one effect on you that prevents you from regain- 
ing hit points. 

- For the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving throws 
against one disease or poison currently 
affecting you. 


RESEARCHING 

The time between adventures is a great chance to per- 
form research, gaining insight into mysteries that have 
unfurled over the course of the campaign. Research can 
include poring over dusty tomes and crumbling scrolls 
in a library or buying drinks for the locals to pry rumors 
and gossip from their lips. 

When you begin your research, the DM determines 
whether the information is available, how many days of 
downtime it will take to find it, and whether there are any 
restrictions on your research (such as needing to seek out 
a specific individual, tome, or location). The DM might 
also require you to make one or more ability checks, 
such as an Intelligence (Investigation) check to find clues 
pointing toward the information you seek, or a Charisma 
(Persuasion) check to secure someone’s aid. Once those 
conditions are met, you learn the information if it is 
available. 

For each day of research, you must spend 1 gp to cover 
your expenses. This cost is in addition to your normal 
lifestyle expenses (as discussed in chapter 5). 


TRAINING 

You can spend time between adventures learning a new 
language or training with a set of tools. Your DM might 
allow additional training options. 

First, you must find an instructor willing to teach you. 
The DM determines how long it takes, and whether one 
or more ability checks are required. 

The training lasts for 250 days and costs 1 gp per day. 
After you spend the requisite amount of time and money, 
you learn the new language or gain proficiency with 
the new tool.

CHAPTER 9: COMBAT 


THE CLATTER OF A SWORD STRIKING AGAINST A SHIELD. 
The terrible rending sound as monstrous claws tear 
through armor. A brilliant flash of light as a ball of flame 
blossoms from a wizard’s spell. The sharp tang of blood 
in the air, cutting through the stench of vile monsters. 
Roars of fury, shouts of triumph, cries of pain. Combat in 
D&amp;D can be chaotic, deadly, and thrilling. 

This chapter provides the rules you need for your char- 
acters and monsters to engage in combat, whether it is 
a brief skirmish or an extended conflict in a dungeon or 
on a field of battle. Throughout this chapter, the rules ad- 
dress you, the player or Dungeon Master. The Dungeon 
Master controls all the monsters and nonplayer charac- 
ters involved in combat, and each other player controls an 
adventurer. “You” can also mean the character or mon- 
ster that you control. 


THE ORDER OF COMBAT 


A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, 
a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and 
spellcasting. The game organizes the chaos of combat 
into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round represents 
about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each 
participant in a battle takes a turn. The order of turns is 
determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when 
everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, 
the fight continues to the next round if neither side has 
defeated the other. 


SURPRISE 


A band of adventurers sneaks up on a bandit camp, 
springing from the trees to attack them. A gelatinous 
cube glides down a dungeon passage, unnoticed by the 
adventurers until the cube engulfs one of them. In these 
situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over 

the other. 

The DM determines who might be surprised. If nei- 
ther side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice 
each other. Otherwise, the DM compares the Dexterity 
(Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wis- 
dom (Perception) score of each creature on the opposing 


sss... Q0° ™ 
COMBAT STEP BY STEP 


1. Determine surprise. The DM determines whether anyone 
involved in the combat encounter is surprised. 

2. Establish positions. The DM decides where all the 
characters and monsters are located. Given the 
adventurers’ marching order or their stated positions in 
the room or other location, the DM figures out where the 
adversaries are—how far away and in what direction. 

3. Roll initiative. Everyone involved in the combat 
encounter rolls initiative, determining the order of 
combatants’ turns. 

4. Take turns. Each participant in the battle takes a turn in 
initiative order. 

5. Begin the next round. When everyone involved in the 
combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 
until the fighting stops. 


side. Any character or monster that doesn’t notice a 
threat is surprised at the start of the encounter. 

If you’re surprised, you can’t move or take an action 
on your first turn of the combat, and you can’t take a re- 
action until that turn ends. A member of a group can be 
surprised even if the other members aren't. 


INITIATIVE 


Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. 
When combat starts, every participant makes a Dexterity 
check to determine their place in the initiative order. The 
DM makes one roll for an entire group of identical crea- 
tures, so each member of the group acts at the same time. 

The DM ranks the combatants in order from the one 
with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with 
the lowest. This is the order (called the initiative order) 
in which they act during each round. The initiative order 
remains the same from round to round. 

If a tie occurs, the DM decides the order among tied 
DM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the or- 
der among their tied characters. The DM can decide the 
order if the tie is between a monster and a player charac- 
ter. Optionally, the DM can have the tied characters and 
monsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest 
roll going first. 


YOUR TURN 


On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed 
and take one action. You decide whether to move first or 
take your action first. Your speed—sometimes called your 
walking speed—is noted on your character sheet. 

The most common actions you can take are described 
in the “Actions in Combat” section later in this chapter. 
Many class features and other abilities provide additional 
options for your action. 

The “Movement and Position” section later in this chap- 
ter gives the rules for your move. 

You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing any- 
thing at all on your turn. If you can’t decide what to do on 
your turn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as 
described in “Actions in Combat.” 


BONuSs ACTIONS 

Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you 
take an additional action on your turn called a bonus ac- 
tion. The Cunning Action feature, for example, allows a 
rogue to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action 
only when a special ability, spell, or other feature of the 
game states that you can do something as a bonus action. 
You otherwise don’t have a bonus action to take. 

You can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you 
must choose which bonus action to use when you have 
more than one available. 

You choose when to take a bonus action during your 
turn, unless the bonus action’s timing is specified, and 
anything that deprives you of your ability to take actions 
also prevents you from taking a bonus action.

OTHER ACTIVITY ON YOUR TURN 
Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require 
neither your action nor your move. 

You can communicate however you are able, through 
brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn. 

You can also interact with one object or feature of the 
environment for free, during either your move or your 
action. For example, you could open a door during your 
move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your 
weapon as part of the same action you use to attack. 

If you want to interact with a second object, you need 
to use your action. Some magic items and other special 
objects always require an action to use, as stated 
in their descriptions. 

The DM might require you to use an action for any 
of these activities when it needs special care or when it 
presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the DM 
could reasonably expect you to use an action to opena 
stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge. 


REACTIONS 


Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you 
to take a special action called a reaction. A reaction is 

an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can 
occur on your turn or on someone else’s. The opportunity 
attack, described later in this chapter, is the most com- 
mon type of reaction. 

When you take a reaction, you can’t take another one 
until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts 
another creature’s turn, that creature can continue its 
turn right after the reaction. 


MOVEMENT AND POSITION 


In combat, characters and monsters are in constant 
motion, often using movement and position to gain the 
upper hand. 





INTERACTING WITH OBJECTS AROUND YOu 


Here are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in 
tandem with your movement and action: 


draw or sheathe a sword 

* open or close a door 

¢ withdraw a potion from your backpack 
pick up a dropped axe 

take a bauble from a table 

* remove a ring from your finger 

« stuff some food into your mouth 

plant a banner in the ground 

fish a few coins from your belt pouch 
« drink all the ale in a flagon 

« throw a lever or a switch 

pull a torch from a sconce 

take a book from a shelf you can reach 
+ extinguish a small flame 

+ don a mask 

pull the hood of your cloak up and over your head 
put your ear to a door 

« kick a small stone 

+ turn a key in a lock 

tap the floor with a 10-foot pole 

hand an item to another character 
ae tl 


D&amp;D Basic Rules 


Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission gr 


On your turn, you can move a distance up to your 
speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as 
you like on your turn, following the rules here. 

Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and 
swimming. These different modes of movement can be 
combined with walking, or they can constitute your entire 
move. However you’re moving, you deduct the distance of 
each part of your move from your speed until it is used up 
or until you are done moving. 

The “Special Types of Movement” section in chap- 
ter 8 gives the particulars for jumping, climbing, 
and swimming. 


BREAKING Up YOUR MOVE 


You can break up your movement on your turn, using 
some of your speed before and after your action. For 
example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 
10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet. 


MOVING BETWEEN ATTACKS 

If you take an action that includes more than one weapon 
attack, you can break up your movement even further by 
moving between those attacks. For example, a fighter 
who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack feature 
and who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make 
an attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again. 


USING DIFFERENT SPEEDS 

If you have more than one speed, such as your walking 
speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth 
between your speeds during your move. Whenever you 
switch, subtract the distance you've already moved from 
the new speed. The result determines how much farther 
you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can’t use the 
new speed during the current move. 

For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying 
speed of 60 because a wizard cast the fly spell on you, 
you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap into 
the air to fly 30 feet more. 


DIFFICULT TERRAIN 


Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on fea- 
tureless plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-choked 
forests, treacherous staircases—the setting of 

a typical fight contains difficult terrain. 

Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 
extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in 
a space count as difficult terrain. 

Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, 
and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The 
space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also 
counts as difficult terrain. 


BEING PRONE 


Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, 
either because they are knocked down or because they 
throw themselves down. In the game, they are prone, 

a condition described in appendix A. 

You can drop prone without using any of your speed. 
Standing up takes more effort; doing so costs an 
amount of movement equal to half your speed. For ex- 
ample, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet 


CHAPTER 9: COMBAT 








»py this document for personal use only 





of movement to stand up. You can’t stand up if you don’t 
have enough movement left or if your speed is 0. 

To move while prone, you must crawl or use magic 
such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while 
crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult 
terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of movement. 


MOvING AROUND OTHER CREATURES 


You can move through a nonhostile creature’s space. In 
contrast, you can move through a hostile creature’s space 
only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller 
than you. Remember that another creature’s space is dif- 
ficult terrain for you. 

Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can’t 
willingly end your move in its space. 

If you leave a hostile creature’s reach during your move, 
you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained later in 
the chapter. 


FLYING MOVEMENT 


Flying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but 
they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying 
creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or 
is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature 
falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held 
aloft by magic, such as by the fly spell. 


CREATURE SIZE 


Each creature takes up a different amount of space. 
The Size Categories table shows how much space 
a creature of a particular size controls in combat. 
Objects sometimes use the same size categories. 


SIZE CATEGORIES 


Size Space Example Monsters 
Tiny 2V2 by 21 ft. Imp, sprite 

Small 5 by 5 ft. Giant rat, goblin 
Medium 5 by 5 ft. Orc, werewolf 

Large 10 by 10 ft. Hippogriff, ogre 
Huge 15 by 15 ft. Fire giant, treant 
Gargantuan 20 by 20ft.orlarger Kraken, purple worm 


SPACE 

A ccreature’s space is the area in feet that it effectively 
controls in combat, not an expression of its physical di- 
mensions. A typical Medium creature isn’t 5 feet wide, 
for example, but it does control a space that wide. Ifa 
Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5-foot-wide doorway, 
other creatures can’t get through unless the hobgoblin 
lets them. 

Acreature’s space also reflects the area it needs to fight 
effectively. For that reason, there’s a limit to the number 
of creatures that can surround another creature in com- 
bat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can 
fit in a 5-foot radius around another one. 

Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer 
of them can surround a creature. If four Large creatures 
crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there’s little 
room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Me- 
dium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one. 


D&amp;D Basic Rules 


Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission gr 


SQUEEZING INTO A SMALLER SPACE 

A creature can squeeze through a space that is large 
enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a 
Large creature can squeeze through a passage that’s only 
5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature 
must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and 
it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving 
throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage 
while it’s in the smaller space. 


ACTIONS IN COMBAT 


When you take your action on your turn, you can take one 
of the actions presented here, an action you gained from 
your class or a special feature, or an action that you im- 
provise. Many monsters have action options of their own 
in their stat blocks. 

When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in 
the rules, the DM tells you whether that action is possible 
and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to deter- 
mine success or failure. 


ATTACK 


The most common action to take in combat is the Attack 
action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an ar- 
row from a bow, or brawling with your fists. 

With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. 
See the “Making an Attack” section for the rules that gov- 
ern attacks. 

Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature 
of the fighter, allow you to make more than one attack 
with this action. 
il 

VARIANT: PLAYING ON A GRID 

If you play out a combat using a square grid and miniatures 
or other tokens, follow these rules. 

Squares. Each square on the grid represents 5 feet. 

Speed. Rather than moving foot by foot, move square by 
square on the grid. This means you use your speed in 5-foot 
segments. This is particularly easy if you translate your 
speed into squares by dividing the speed by 5. For example, 

a speed of 30 feet translates into a speed of 6 squares. 

If you use a grid often, consider writing your speed in 
squares on your character sheet. 

Entering a Square. To enter a square, you must have 
at least 1 square of movement left, even if the square 
is diagonally adjacent to the square you’re in. (The rule 
for diagonal movement sacrifices realism for the sake of 
smooth play. The Dungeon Master’s Guide provides guidance 
on using a more realistic approach.) 

If a square costs extra movement, as a square of 
difficult terrain does, you must have enough movement 
left to pay for entering it. For example, you must have 
at least 2 squares of movement left to enter a square of 
difficult terrain. 

Corners. Diagonal movement can’t cross the corner of a 
wall, large tree, or other terrain feature that fills its space. 

Ranges. To determine the range on a grid between two 
things—whether creatures or objects—start counting 
squares from a square adjacent to one of them and stop 
counting in the space of the other one. Count by the 
shortest route.

CAST A SPELL 


Spellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many 
monsters, have access to spells and can use them to great 
effect in combat. Each spell has a casting time, which 
specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reac- 
tion, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a 
spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells 
do have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often 
uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell. See 
chapter 10 for the rules on spellcasting. 


DASH 


When you take the Dash action, you gain extra move- 
ment for the current turn. The increase equals your 
speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 
feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn 
if you dash. 

Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this 
additional movement by the same amount. If your speed 
of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move 
up to 30 feet this turn if you dash. 


DISENGAGE 


If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn’t 
provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn. 


DODGE 


When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on 
avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any 
attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can 
see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws 
with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are inca- 
pacitated (as explained in appendix A) or if your speed 
drops to 0. 


HELP 


You can lend your aid to another creature in the com- 
pletion of a task. When you take the Help action, the 
creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability 
check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, 
provided that it makes the check before the start of your 
next turn. 

Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attack- 
ing acreature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract 
the target, or in some other way team up to make your 
ally’s attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target 
before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with 
advantage.

IMPROVISING AN ACTION 
Your character can do things not covered by the actions in 
this chapter, such as breaking down doors, intimidating 
enemies, sensing weaknesses in magical defenses, or 
calling for a parley with a foe. The only limits to the actions 
you can attempt are your imagination and your character’s 
ability scores. See the descriptions of the ability scores in 
chapter 7 for inspiration as you improvise. 

When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in 
the rules, the DM tells you whether that action is possible 
and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine 
success or failure. 


HIDE 


When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity 
(Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules 
in chapter 7 for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain 
benefits, as described in the “Unseen Attackers and Tar- 
gets” section later in this chapter. 


READY 


Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a 
particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can 
take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act us- 
ing your reaction before the start of your next turn. 

First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will 
trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you 
will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to 
move up to your speed in response to it. Examples in- 
clude “If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I’ll pull the 
lever that opens it,” and “If the goblin steps next to me, I 
move away.” 

When the trigger occurs, you can either take your re- 
action right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. 
Remember that you can take only one reaction per round. 

When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold 
its energy, which you release with your reaction when the 
trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a cast- 
ing time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell’s magic 
requires concentration (explained in chapter 10). If your 
concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without tak- 
ing effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the 
web spell and ready magic missile, your web spell ends, 
and if you take damage before you release magic missile 
with your reaction, your concentration might be broken. 


SEARCH 


When you take the Search action, you devote your 
attention to finding something. Depending on the na- 
ture of your search, the DM might have you make a 
Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investiga- 
tion) check. 


USE AN OBJECT 


You normally interact with an object while doing some- 
thing else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an 
attack. When an object requires your action for its use, 
you take the Use an Object action. This action is also use- 
ful when you want to interact with more than one object 
on your turn. 


MAKING AN ATTACK 


Whether you're striking with a melee weapon, firing a 
weapon at range, or making an attack roll as part ofa 
spell, an attack has a simple structure. 


1. Choose a target. Pick a target within your attack’s 
range: a creature, an object, or a location. 

2. Determine modifiers. The DM determines whether 
the target has cover and whether you have advantage 
or disadvantage against the target. In addition, spells, 


CHAPTER 9: COMBAT 





D&amp;D Basic Rules 


Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission gr 





»py this document for personal use only 





special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties 
or bonuses to your attack roll. 

3. Resolve the attack. You make the attack roll. On a hit, 
you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules 
that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special 
effects in addition to or instead of damage. 


If there’s ever any question whether something you're 
doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you’re 
making an attack roll, you’re making an attack. 


ATTACK ROLLS 


When you make an attack, your attack roll determines 
whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, 
roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total 
of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target’s 
Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. The AC of a character 
is determined at character creation, whereas the AC ofa 
monster is in its stat block. 


MODIFIERS TO THE ROLL 

When a character makes an attack roll, the two most 
common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier 
and the character’s proficiency bonus. When a monster 
makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is pro- 
vided in its stat block. 

Ability Modifier. The ability modifier used for a melee 
weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used 
for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that 
have the finesse or thrown property break this rule. 

Some spells also require an attack roll. The ability 
modifier used for a spell attack depends on the spellcast- 
ing ability of the spellcaster, as explained in chapter 10. 

Proficiency Bonus. You add your proficiency bonus 
to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with 
which you have proficiency, as well as when you attack 
with a spell. 


ROLLING | OR 20 
Sometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing 
the novice to hit and the veteran to miss. 

If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits re- 
gardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC. This is called 
a critical hit, which is explained later in this chapter. 

If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses re- 
gardless of any modifiers or the target’s AC. 


UNSEEN ATTACKERS AND TARGETS 


Combatants often try to escape their foes’ notice by hid- 


ing, casting the invisibility spell, or lurking in darkness. 

When you attack a target that you can’t see, you have 
disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether 
you're guessing the target’s location or you're targeting a 
creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn’t in the 
location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the DM 
typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you 
guessed the target’s location correctly. 

When a creature can’t see you, you have advantage on 
attack rolls against it. 

If you are hidden—both unseen and unheard—when 
you make an attack, you give away your location when the 
attack hits or misses. 


RANGED ATTACKS 


When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a 
crossbow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projec- 
tiles to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might shoot 
spines from its tail. Many spells also involve making a 
ranged attack. 


RANGE 
You can make ranged attacks only against targets within 
a specified range. 
If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a 
single range, you can’t attack a target beyond this range. 
Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a long- 
bow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller number 
is the normal range, and the larger number is the long 
range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target 
is beyond normal range, and you can't attack a target be- 
yond the long range. 


RANGED ATTACKS IN CLOSE COMBAT 

Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe 

is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a 
weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have disadvan- 
tage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile 
creature who can see you and who isn’t incapacitated. 


MELEE ATTACKS 


Used in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you 
to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically 
uses a handheld weapon such as a sword, a warham- 
mer, or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee attack 
when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or 
other body part. A few spells also involve making a me- 
lee attack. 

Most creatures have a 5-foot reach and can thus at- 
tack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee 
attack. Certain creatures (typically those larger than 
Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 5 
feet, as noted in their descriptions. 

Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon 
attack, you can use an unarmed strike: a punch, kick, 
head-butt, or similar forceful blow (none of which count 
as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeon- 
ing damage equal to 1 + your Strength modifier. You are 
proficient with your unarmed strikes. 


OPPORTUNITY ATTACKS 

In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for enemies 
to drop their guard. You can rarely move heedlessly past 
your foes without putting yourself in danger; doing so 
provokes an opportunity attack. 

You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile 
creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To 
make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction 
to make one melee attack against the provoking crea- 
ture. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves 
your reach. 

You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by 
taking the Disengage action. You also don’t provoke an 
opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone 
or something moves you without using your movement, 
action, or reaction. For example, you don’t provoke an 


CHAPTER 9: COMBAT 








D&amp;D Basic Rules 


(Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocop 





this document for personal use only 








opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe’s 
reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy. 


Two-WEAPON FIGHTING 
When you take the Attack action and attack with a light 
melee weapon that you're holding in one hand, you can 
use a bonus action to attack with a different light melee 
weapon that you're holding in the other hand. You don’t 
add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus at- 
tack, unless that modifier is negative. 

If either weapon has the thrown property, you can 
throw the weapon, instead of making a melee at- 
tack with it. 


GRAPPLING 

When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you 
can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, 
a grapple. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the 
Attack action, this attack replaces one of them. 

The target of your grapple must be no more than one 
size larger than you, and it must be within your reach. 
Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target 
by making a grapple check, a Strength (Athletics) check 
contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity 
(Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). 
You succeed automatically if the target is incapacitated. If 
you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled condi- 
tion (See appendix A). The condition specifies the things 
that end it, and you can release the target whenever you 
like (no action required). 

Escaping a Grapple. A grappled creature can use its 
action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength 
(Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by 
your Strength (Athletics) check. 

Moving a Grappled Creature. When you move, you 
can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but 
your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more 
sizes smaller than you. 


SHOVING A CREATURE 
Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee at- 
tack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push 
it away from you. If you're able to make multiple attacks 
with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them. 
The target of your shove must be no more than one 
size larger than you, and it must be within your reach. 
You make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by 
the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobat- 
ics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). You 
succeed automatically if the target is incapacitated. If 
you succeed, you either knock the target prone or push 
it 5 feet away from you. 


COVER 


Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide 
cover during combat, making a target more difficult 

to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an 
attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of 
the cover. 

There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind 
multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree 
of cover applies; the degrees aren't added together. For 
example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half

CONTESTS IN COMBAT 
Battle often involves pitting your prowess against that of 
your foe. Such a challenge is represented by a contest. This 
section includes the most common contests that require an 
action in combat: grappling and shoving a creature. The DM 
can use these contests as models for improvising others. 
————o~—EeEeEeEeEeEeEeEeEeEeEyc~0_GOeeeee————e eee 


cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the 
target has three-quarters cover. 

A target with half cover has a +2 bonus to AC and 
Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an ob- 
stacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might 
be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree 
trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy 
or a friend. 

A target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus to 
AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quar- 
ters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an 
obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow 
slit, or a thick tree trunk. 

A target with total cover can’t be targeted directly by 
an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such 
a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has 
total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle. 


DAMAGE AND HEALING 


Injury and the risk of death are constant companions 

of those who explore the worlds of D&amp;D. The thrust of 

a sword, a well-placed arrow, or a blast of flame from a 
fireball spell all have the potential to damage, or even kill, 
the hardiest of creatures. 


HiT PoINtTs 


Hit points represent a combination of physical and men- 
tal durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with 
more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with 
fewer hit points are more fragile. 

A creature’s current hit points (usually just called hit 
points) can be any number from the creature’s hit point 
maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as 
a creature takes damage or receives healing. 

Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is 
subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has 
no effect on a creature’s capabilities until the creature 
drops to 0 hit points. 


DAMAGE ROLLS 


Each weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability speci- 
fies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, 
add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target. 
Magic weapons, special abilities, and other factors can 
grant a bonus to damage. 

When attacking with a weapon, you add your ability 
modifier—the same modifier used for the attack roll—to 
the damage. A spell tells you which dice to roll for dam- 
age and whether to add any modifiers. 

If a spell or other effect deals damage to more than 
one target at the same time, roll the damage once for all 
of them. For example, when a wizard casts fireball or a 


CHAPTER 9: COMBAT 





D&amp;D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission grantec 


to print and photocopy this document for personal use only 





RICHARD WHITTERS 


cleric casts flame strike, the spell’s damage is rolled once 
for all creatures caught in the blast. 


CRITICAL HITs 

When you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice 
for the attack’s damage against the target. Roll all of the 
attack’s damage dice twice and add them together. Then 
add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, 
you can roll all the damage dice at once. 

For example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, 
roll 2d4 for the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add 
your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other 
damage dice, such as from the rogue’s Sneak Attack fea- 
ture, you roll those dice twice as well. 


DAMAGE TYPES 

Different attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful 
effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have 
no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage re- 
sistance, rely on the types. 

The damage types follow, with examples to help a 
DM assign a damage type to a new effect. 

Acid. The corrosive spray of a black dragon’s breath 
and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding 
deal acid damage. 

Bludgeoning. Blunt force attacks—hammers, falling, 
constriction, and the like—deal bludgeoning damage. 

Cold. The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil’s 
spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon’s breath 
deal cold damage. 

Fire. Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells con- 
jure flames to deal fire damage. 

Force. Force is pure magical energy focused into a 
damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are 
spells, including magic missile and spiritual weapon. 

Lightning. A lightning bolt spell and a blue dragon’s 
breath deal lightning damage. 

Necrotic. Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead 
and some spells, withers matter and even the soul. 

Piercing. Puncturing and impaling attacks, including 
spears and monsters’ bites, deal piercing damage. 

Poison. Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green 
dragon’s breath deal poison damage. 

Psychic. Mental abilities such as a mind flayer’s psionic 
blast deal psychic damage. 

Radiant. Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric’s fame 
strike spell or an angel’s smiting weapon, sears the flesh 
like fire and overloads the spirit with power. 

Slashing. Swords, axes, and monsters’ claws deal 
slashing damage. 

Thunder. A concussive burst of sound, such as the ef- 
fect of the thunderwave spell, deals thunder damage. 


5 
DESCRIBING THE EFFECTS OF DAMAGE 
Dungeon Masters describe hit point loss in different ways. 
When your current hit point total is half or more of your 
hit point maximum, you typically show no signs of injury. 
When you drop below half your hit point maximum, you 
show signs of wear, such as cuts and bruises. An attack 
that reduces you to 0 hit points strikes you directly, leaving 
a bleeding injury or other trauma, or it simply knocks you 
unconscious. 





DAMAGE RESISTANCE AND 
VULNERABILITY 


Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or 
unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage. 

If a creature or an object has resistance to a damage 
type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a crea- 
ture or an object has vulnerability to a damage type, 
damage of that type is doubled against it. 

Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all 
other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has 
resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack 
that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also 
within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 
25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the 
creature takes 10 damage. 

Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that 
affect the same damage type count as only one instance. 
For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage 
as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the dam- 
age of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the 
creature, not reduced by three-quarters.

RICHARD WHITTERS 





HEALING 


Unless it results in death, damage isn’t permanent. Even 


death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can 
restore a creature’s hit points (as explained in chapter 8), 
and magical methods such as a cure wounds spell or a 
potion of healing can remove damage in an instant. 

When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points 
regained are added to its current hit points. A creature’s 
hit points can’t exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit 
points regained in excess of this number are lost. For 
example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. 
If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point 
maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the 
druid, not 8. 

A creature that has died can’t regain hit points until 
magic such as the revivify spell has restored it to life. 


DROPPING TO O HIT POINTS 


When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or 


fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections. 


INSTANT DEATH 

Massive damage can kill you instantly. When dam- 
age reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage 
remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals 
or exceeds your hit point maximum. 

For example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points 
currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from 
an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage 
remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit 
point maximum, the cleric dies. 


FALLING UNCONSCIOUS 

If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, 
you fall unconscious (See appendix A). This unconscious- 
ness ends if you regain any hit points. 


DEATH SAVING THROWS 

Whenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must 
make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, 
to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang 
onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn’t tied to 
any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided 
only by spells and features that improve your chances of 
succeeding on a saving throw. 

Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. 
Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect 
by itself. On your third success, you become stable (See 
below). On your third failure, you die. The successes 
and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track 
of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of 
both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or be- 
come stable. 

Rolling 1 or 20. When you make a death saving throw 
and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you 
roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point. 

Damage at 0 Hit Points. If you take any damage while 
you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw 
failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two 
failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit 
point maximum, you suffer instant death. 


STABILIZING A CREATURE 

The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to 
heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at 
least be stabilized so that it isn’t killed by a failed death 
saving throw. 

You can use your action to administer first aid to an 
unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which 
requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check. 

A stable creature doesn’t make death saving throws, 
even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain un- 
conscious. The creature stops being stable, and must 
start making death saving throws again, if it takes any 
damage. A stable creature that isn’t healed regains 
1 hit point after 1d4 hours. 


MONSTERS AND DEATH 
Most DMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 
0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious and 
make death saving throws. 

Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are 
common exceptions; the DM might have them fall uncon- 
scious and follow the same rules as player characters. 


KNOCKING A CREATURE OUT 


Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather 
than deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a 
creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker 
can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this 
choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls 
unconscious and is stable. 


CHAPTER 9: COMBAT 








D&amp;D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission granted to print and photocopy this document for personal use only 





TEMPORARY HIT POINTS 


Some spells and special abilities confer temporary hit 
points to acreature. Temporary hit points aren’t actual 
hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit 
points that protect you from injury. 

When you have temporary hit points and take damage, 
the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover 
damage carries over to your normal hit points. For 
example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 
7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then 
take 2 damage. 

Because temporary hit points are separate from your 
actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maxi- 
mum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit points and 
receive temporary hit points. 

Healing can’t restore temporary hit points, and they 
can’t be added together. If you have temporary hit points 
and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep 
the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, 
if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you 
already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22. 

If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points 
doesn’t restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. 
They can still absorb damage directed at you while you're 
in that state, but only true healing can save you. 

Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points 
has a duration, they last until they’re depleted or you fin- 
ish a long rest. 


MOUNTED COMBAT 


A knight charging into battle on a warhorse, a wizard 
casting spells from the back of a griffon, or a cleric soar- 
ing through the sky on a pegasus all enjoy the benefits of 
speed and mobility that a mount can provide. 

A willing creature that is at least one size larger than 
you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a 
mount, using the following rules. 


MOUNTING AND DISMOUNTING 


Once during your move, you can mount a creature that 
is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an 
amount of movement equal to half your speed. For ex- 
ample, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet 
of movement to mount a horse. Therefore, you can’t 
mount it if you don’t have 15 feet of movement left or 

if your speed is 0. 

If an effect moves your mount against its will while 
you're on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity sav- 
ing throw or fall off the mount, landing prone in a space 
within 5 feet of it. If you’re knocked prone while mounted, 
you must make the same saving throw. 

If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your 
reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. 
Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone ina 
space within 5 feet it. 


CONTROLLING A MOUNT 


While you’re mounted, you have two options. You can 
either control the mount or allow it to act independently. 
Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, act independently. 

You can control a mount only if it has been trained to 
accept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and sim- 
ilar creatures are assumed to have such training. The 
initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours 
when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has 
only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A 
controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that 
you mount it. 

An independent mount retains its place in the initiative 
order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions 
the mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It 
might flee from combat, rush to attack and devour a badly 
injured foe, or otherwise act against your wishes. 

In either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity 
attack while you're on it, the attacker can target you or 
the mount. 


UNDERWATER COMBAT 


When adventurers pursue sahuagin back to their under- 
sea homes, fight off sharks in an ancient shipwreck, or 
find themselves in a flooded dungeon room, they must 
fight in a challenging environment. Underwater the fol- 
lowing rules apply. 

When making a melee weapon attack, a creature that 
doesn’t have a swimming speed (either natural or granted 
by magic) has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the 
weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident. 

A ranged weapon attack automatically misses a target 
beyond the weapon’s normal range. Even against a target 
within normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage un- 
less the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is 
thrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or dart). 

Creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water 
have resistance to fire damage.

CHAPTER 10: SPELLCASTING 


MAGIC PERMEATES THE WORLDS OF D&amp;D AND MOST OFTEN 
appears in the form of a spell. 

This chapter provides the rules for casting spells. 
Different character classes have distinctive ways of 
learning and preparing their spells, and monsters 
use spells in unique ways. Regardless of its source, 

a spell follows the rules here. 


WHAT Is A SPELL? 


A spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping of 
the magical energies that suffuse the multiverse into a 
specific, limited expression. In casting a spell, a charac- 
ter carefully plucks at the invisible strands of raw magic 
suffusing the world, pins them in place in a particular 
pattern, sets them vibrating in a specific way, and then re- 
leases them to unleash the desired effect—in most cases, 
all in the span of seconds. 

Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective 
wards. They can deal damage or undo it, impose or re- 
move conditions (see appendix A), drain life energy away, 
and restore life to the dead. 

Uncounted thousands of spells have been created 
over the course of the multiverse’s history, and many of 
them are long forgotten. Some might yet lie recorded in 
crumbling spellbooks hidden in ancient ruins or trapped 
in the minds of dead gods. Or they might someday be re- 
invented by a character who has amassed enough power 
and wisdom to do so. 


SPELL LEVEL 


Every spell has a level from 0 to 9. A spell’s level is a gen- 


eral indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly (but 
still impressive) magic missile at 1st level and the incredi- 
ble time stop at 9th. Cantrips—simple but powerful spells 
that characters can cast almost by rote—are level 0. The 
higher a spell’s level, the higher level a spellcaster must 
be to use that spell. 

Spell level and character level don’t correspond di- 
rectly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th level, 
not 9th level, to cast a 9th-level spell. 


KNOWN AND PREPARED SPELLS 


Before a spellcaster can use a spell, he or she must have 


the spell firmly fixed in mind, or must have access to the 
spell in a magic item. Members of a few classes have a 
limited list of spells they know that are always fixed in 
mind. The same thing is true of many magic-using mon- 
sters. Other spellcasters, such as clerics and wizards, 
undergo a process of preparing spells. This process var- 
ies for different classes, as detailed in their descriptions. 

In every case, the number of spells a caster can have 
fixed in mind at any given time depends on the charac- 
ter’s level. 


SPELL SLOTS 


Regardless of how many spells a caster knows or pre- 
pares, he or she can cast only a limited number of spells 
before resting. Manipulating the fabric of magic and 
channeling its energy into even a simple spell is phys- 
ically and mentally taxing, and higher-level spells are 
even more so. Thus, each spellcasting class’s description 
includes a table showing how many spell slots of each 
spell level a character can use at each character level. For 
example, the 3rd-level wizard Umara has four 1st-level 
spell slots and two 2nd-level slots. 

When a character casts a spell, he or she expends a 
slot of that spell’s level or higher, effectively “filling” a slot 
with the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of 
a certain size—small for a 1st-level slot, larger for a spell 
of higher level. A 1st-level spell fits into a slot of any size, 
but a 9th-level spell fits only in a 9th-level slot. So when 
Umara casts magic missile, a 1st-level spell, she spends 
one of her four 1st-level slots and has three remaining. 

Finishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots 
(see chapter 8 for the rules on resting). 

Some characters and monsters have special abilities 
that let them cast spells without using spell slots. 


CASTING A SPELL AT A HIGHER LEVEL 
When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a 
higher level than the spell, the spell assumes the higher 
level for that casting. For instance, if Umara casts magic 
missile using one of her 2nd-level slots, that magic mis- 
sile is 2nd level. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the 
slot it is put into. 

Some spells, such as magic missile and cure wounds, 
have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as 
detailed in a spell’s description. 


CANTRIPS 


Acantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, without using 
a spell slot and without being prepared in advance. Re- 
peated practice has fixed the spell in the caster’s mind 
and infused the caster with the magic needed to produce 
the effect over and over. A cantrip’s spell level is 0. 


RITUALS 


Certain spells have a special tag: ritual. Such a spell 

can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, 
or the spell can be cast as a ritual. The ritual version of a 
spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal. 

It also doesn’t expend a spell slot, which means the ritual 
version of a spell can’t be cast at a higher level. 

To cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster must have a 
feature that grants the ability to do so. The cleric and the 
druid, for example, have such a feature. The caster must 
also have the spell prepared or on his or her list of spells 
known, unless the character’s ritual feature specifies oth- 
erwise, as the wizard’s does.

CASTING A SPELL 


When a character casts any spell, the same basic rules 
are followed, regardless of the character’s class or the 
spell’s effects. 

Each spell description in chapter 11 begins with a block 
of information, including the spell’s name, level, school of 
magic, casting time, range, components, and duration. The 
rest of a spell entry describes the spell’s effect. 


CASTING TIME 


Most spells require a single action to cast, but some 
spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more 
time to cast. 


BONus ACTION 

A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You 
must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, 
provided that you haven't already taken a bonus action 
this turn. You can’t cast another spell during the same 
turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action. 


REACTIONS 

Some spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take 

a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in re- 
sponse to some event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, 
the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so. 


LONGER CASTING TIMES 

Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require 
more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast 
a spell with a casting time longer than a single action or 
reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting 
the spell, and you must maintain your concentration 
while you do so (see “Concentration” below). If your con- 
centration is broken, the spell fails, but you don’t expend 
a spell slot. If you want to try casting the spell again, you 
must start over. 


RANGE 


The target of a spell must be within the spell’s range. For 
a spell like magic missile, the target is a creature. For a 
spell like fireball, the target is the point in space where 
the ball of fire erupts. 

Most spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some spells 
can target only a creature (including you) that you touch. 
Other spells, such as the shield spell, affect only you. 
These spells have a range of self. 

Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate 
from you also have a range of self, indicating that the or- 
igin point of the spell’s effect must be you (see “Areas of 
Effect” later in the this chapter). 

Once a spell is cast, its effects aren't limited by its range, 
unless the spell’s description says otherwise. 


ELON... 
CASTING IN ARMOR 
Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required 
for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you 
are wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted 
and physically hampered by your armor for spellcasting. 
——K—mvooSS=—S_——aS 


COMPONENTS 


A spell’s components are the physical requirements you 
must meet in order to cast it. Each spell’s description 
indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), 

or material (M) components. If you can’t provide one 

or more of a spell’s components, you are unable to cast 
the spell. 


VERBAL (V) 

Most spells require the chanting of mystic words. The 
words themselves aren't the source of the spell’s power; 
rather, the particular combination of sounds, with spe- 
cific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in 
motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area 
of silence, such as one created by the silence spell, can’t 
cast a spell with a verbal component. 


Somatic (S) 

Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticula- 
tion or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a 
somatic component, the caster must have free use of at 
least one hand to perform these gestures. 


MATERIAL (M) 

Casting some spells requires particular objects, specified 
in parentheses in the component entry. A character can 
use a component pouch or a spellcasting focus (found 
in chapter 5) in place of the components specified for a 
spell. But if a cost is indicated for a component, a char- 
acter must have that specific component before he or she 
can cast the spell. 

If a spell states that a material component is consumed 
by the spell, the caster must provide this component for 
each casting of the spell. 

A spellcaster must have a hand free to access these 
components—or to hold a spellcasting focus—but it can 
be the same hand that he or she uses to perform somatic 
components. 


DURATION 


A spell’s duration is the length of time the spell persists. 
A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, 
or even years. Some spells specify that their effects last 
until the spells are dispelled or destroyed. 


INSTANTANEOUS 

Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, 
creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that 
can’t be dispelled, because its magic exists only for 

an instant. 


CONCENTRATION 

Some spells require you to maintain concentration in or- 
der to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, 
such a spell ends. 

If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that 
fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies 
how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concen- 
tration at any time (no action required). 


CHAPTER 10: SPELLCASTING 





D&amp;D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Pe 





copy this document for personal use only 





Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn’t 
interfere with concentration. The following factors can 
break concentration: 


- Casting another spell that requires concentration. 
You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another 
spell that requires concentration. You can’t concentrate 
on two spells at once. 

- Taking damage. Whenever you take damage while 
you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a 
Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentra- 
tion. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, 
whichever number is higher. If you take damage from 
multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon's 
breath, you make a separate saving throw for each 
source of damage. 

- Being incapacitated or killed. You lose concentration 
on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die. 


The DM might also decide that certain environmental 
phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while 
you're on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed ona 
DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentra- 
tion on a spell. 


TARGETS 


A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets 
to be affected by the spell’s magic. A spell’s description 
tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a 
point of origin for an area of effect (described below). 
Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might 
not know it was targeted by a spell at all. An effect like 
crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, 
such as an attempt to read a creature’s thoughts, typically 
goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise. 


A CLEAR PATH TO THE TARGET 
To target something, you must have a clear path to it, 
so it can’t be behind total cover. 

If you place an area of effect at a point that you can’t 
see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you 
and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the 
near side of that obstruction. 


TARGETING YOURSELF 

If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can 
choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or 
specifically a creature other than you. If you are in the 
area of effect of a spell you cast, you can target yourself. 


AREAS OF EFFECT 


Spells such as burning hands and cone of cold cover an 


area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once. 

A spell’s description specifies its area of effect, which 
typically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube, cyl- 
inder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a point of 
origin, a location from which the spell’s energy erupts. 
The rules for each shape specify how you position its 
point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in 
space, but some spells have an area whose origin is a 
creature or an object. 

A spell’s effect expands in straight lines from the point 
of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the 
point of origin to a location within the area of effect, that 


te, 
THE SCHOOLS OF MaGic 
Academies of magic group spells into eight categories 
called schools of magic. Scholars, particularly wizards, 
apply these categories to all spells, believing that all magic 
functions in essentially the same way, whether it derives 
from rigorous study or is bestowed by a deity. 

The schools of magic help describe spells; they have no 
rules of their own, although some rules refer to the schools. 
Abjuration spells are protective in nature, though some 
of them have aggressive uses. They create magical barriers, 
negate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish 

creatures to other planes of existence. 

Conjuration spells involve the transportation of objects 
and creatures from one location to another. Some spells 
summon creatures or objects to the caster’s side, whereas 
others allow the caster to teleport to another location. Some 
conjurations create objects or effects out of nothing. 

Divination spells reveal information, whether in the 
form of secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the 
locations of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or 
visions of distant people or places. 

Enchantment spells affect the minds of others, 
influencing or controlling their behavior. Such spells can 
make enemies see the caster as a friend, force creatures to 
take a course of action, or even control another creature 
like a puppet. 

Evocation spells manipulate magical energy to produce 
a desired effect. Some call up blasts of fire or lightning. 
Others channel positive energy to heal wounds. 

Illusion spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They 
cause people to see things that are not there, to miss things 
that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember 
things that never happened. Some illusions create phantom 
images that any creature can see, but the most insidious 
illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature. 

Necromancy spells manipulate the energies of life and 
death. Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force, 
drain the life energy from another creature, create the 
undead, or even bring the dead back to life. 

Creating the undead through the use of necromancy 
spells such as animate dead is not a good act, and only evil 
casters use such spells frequently. 

Transmutation spells change the properties of a creature, 
object, or environment. They might turn an enemy into 
a harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, make 
an object move at the caster’s command, or enhance 
a creature’s innate healing abilities to rapidly recover 
from injury. 

aaa 


location isn’t included in the spell’s area. To block one of 
these imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total 
cover, as explained in chapter 9. 


CONE 
Acone extends in a direction you choose from its point of 
origin. A cone’s width at a given point along its length is 
equal to that point’s distance from the point of origin. A 
cone’s area of effect specifies its maximum length. 

A cone’s point of origin is not included in the cone’s 
area of effect, unless you decide otherwise. 


CUBE 
You select a cube’s point of origin, which lies anywhere 
on a face of the cubic effect. The cube’s size is expressed 
as the length of each side. 

A cube’s point of origin is not included in the cube’s 
area of effect, unless you decide otherwise. 


CHAPTER 10: SPELLCASTING

RICHARD WHITTERS 


CYLINDER 
A cylinder’s point of origin is the center ofa circle of a 
particular radius, as given in the spell description. The 
circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the 
spell effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight 
lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the cir- 
cle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell’s effect 
then shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a 
distance equal to the height of the cylinder. 

Acylinder’s point of origin is included in the cylinder’s 
area of effect. 


LINE 

A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path 

up to its length and covers an area defined by its width. 
A line’s point of origin is not included in the line’s area 

of effect, unless you decide otherwise. 


SPHERE 

You select a sphere’s point of origin, and the sphere 

extends outward from that point. The sphere’s size is ex- 

pressed as a radius in feet that extends from the point. 
A sphere’s point of origin is included in the sphere’s 

area of effect. 


SAVING THROWS 


Many spells specify that a target can make a saving 
throw to avoid some or all of a spell’s effects. The spell 
specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and 
what happens on a success or failure. 

The DC to resist one of your spells equals 8 + your 
spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + 
any special modifiers. 


ATTACK ROLLS 


Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll 
to determine whether the spell effect hits the intended 
target. Your attack bonus with a spell attack equals your 
spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus. 
Most spells that require attack rolls involve ranged 
attacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a 
ranged attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile 
creature that can see you and that isn’t incapacitated (see 
chapter 9). 





COMBINING MAGICAL EFFECTS 


The effects of different spells add together while the du- 
rations of those spells overlap. The effects of the same 
spell cast multiple times don’t combine, however. Instead, 
the most potent effect—such as the highest bonus—from 
those castings applies while their durations overlap. Or 
the most recent effect applies if the castings are equally 
potent and their durations overlap. 

For example, if two clerics cast bless on the same tar- 
get, that character gains the spell’s benefit only once; he 
or she doesn’t get to roll two bonus dice. 


etl 
THE WEAVE OF Macic 


The worlds within the D&amp;D multiverse are magical 
places. All existence is suffused with magical power, and 
potential energy lies untapped in every rock, stream, and 
living creature, and even in the air itself. Raw magic is the 
stuff of creation, the mute and mindless will of existence, 
permeating every bit of matter and present in every 
manifestation of energy throughout the multiverse. 

Mortals can’t directly shape this raw magic. Instead, they 
make use of a fabric of magic, a kind of interface between 
the will of a spellcaster and the stuff of raw magic. The 
spellcasters of the Forgotten Realms call it the Weave and 
recognize its essence as the goddess Mystra, but casters 
have varied ways of naming and visualizing this interface. 
By any name, without the Weave, raw magic is locked away 
and inaccessible; the most powerful archmage can’t light 
a candle with magic in an area where the Weave has been 
torn. But surrounded by the Weave, a spellcaster can shape 
lightning to blast foes, transport hundreds of miles in the 
blink of an eye, or even reverse death itself. 

All magic depends on the Weave, though different kinds 
of magic access it in a variety of ways. The spells of wizards, 
warlocks, sorcerers, and bards are commonly called arcane 
magic. These spells rely on an understanding—learned or 
intuitive—of the workings of the Weave. The caster plucks 
directly at the strands of the Weave to create the desired 
effect. Eldritch knights and arcane tricksters also use arcane 
magic. The spells of clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers 
are called divine magic. These spellcasters’ access to the 
Weave is mediated by divine power—gods, the divine forces 
of nature, or the sacred weight of a paladin’s oath. 

Whenever a magic effect is created, the threads of 
the Weave intertwine, twist, and fold to make the effect 
possible. When characters use divination spells such as 
detect magic or identify, they glimpse the Weave. A spell such 
as dispel magic smooths the Weave. Spells such as antimagic 
field rearrange the Weave so that magic flows around, 
rather than through, the area affected by the spell. And in 
places where the Weave is damaged or torn, magic works in 
unpredictable ways—or not at all.

SPELL DESCRIPTIONS 


The spells are presented in alphabetical order. 


ACID SPLASH 
Conjuration cantrip 


Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 60 feet 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Instantaneous 


You hurl a bubble of acid. Choose one or two creatures 
you can see within range. If you choose two, they must 
be within 5 feet of each other. A target must succeed on a 
Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 acid damage. 

This spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 
5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6). 


AID 


2nd-level abjuration 


Casting Time: 1 action 

Range: 30 feet 

Components: V, S, M (a tiny strip of white cloth) 
Duration: 8 hours 


Your spell bolsters your allies with toughness and re- 
solve. Choose up to three creatures within range. Each 
target’s hit point maximum and current hit points in- 
crease by 5 for the duration. 

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, a target’s hit points in- 
crease by an additional 5 for each slot level above 2nd. 


ANTIMAGIC FIELD 
S&amp;th-level abjuration 


Casting Time: 1 action 

Range: Self (10-foot-radius sphere) 

Components: V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron or 
iron filings) 

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour 


A 10-foot-radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds 
you. This area is divorced from the magical energy that 
suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can’t 
be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic 
items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere 
moves with you, centered on you. 

Spells and other magical effects, except those created 
by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere 
and can’t protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a sup- 
pressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, 
it doesn’t function, but the time it spends suppressed 
counts against its duration. 

Targeted Effects. Spells and other magical effects, 
such as magic missile and charm person, that target 
a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on 
that target. 

Areas of Magic. The area of another spell or magical 
effect, such as fireball, can’t extend into the sphere. If the 
sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area 
that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, 
the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within 
the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is 
large enough. 


Spells. Any active spell or other magical effect on a 
creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while 
the creature or object is in it. 

Magic Items. The properties and powers of magic 
items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a 
+1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical 
longsword. 

A magic weapon’s properties and powers are sup- 
pressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or 
wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon 
or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere 
(for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic 
spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the 
item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits. 

Magical Travel. Teleportation and planar travel fail to 
work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination 
or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal 
to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well 
as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that 
created by the rope trick spell, temporarily closes while 
in the sphere. 

Creatures and Objects. A creature or object sum- 
moned or created by magic temporarily winks out of 
existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reap- 
pears once the space the creature occupied is no longer 
within the sphere. 

Dispel Magic. Spells and magical effects such as dispel 
magic have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres 
created by different antimagic field spells don’t nullify 
each other. 


ARCANE EYE 
4th-level divination 


Casting Time: 1 action 

Range: 30 feet 

Components: V, S, M (a bit of bat fur) 
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour 


You create an invisible, magical eye within range that 
hovers in the air for the duration. 

You mentally receive visual information from the eye, 
which has normal vision and darkvision out to 30 feet. 
The eye can look in every direction. 

As an action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in 
any direction. There is no limit to how far away from 
you the eye can move, but it can’t enter another plane of 
existence. A solid barrier blocks the eye’s movement, but 
the eye can pass through an opening as small as 1 inch 
in diameter. 


ARCANE LOCK 
2nd-level abjuration 


Casting Time: 1 action 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M (gold dust worth at least 25 gp, 
which the spell consumes) 

Duration: Until dispelled 


You touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other en- 
tryway, and it becomes locked for the duration. You and 
the creatures you designate when you cast this spell can 
open the object normally. You can also set a password 
that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, suppresses 
this spell for 1 minute. Otherwise, it is impassable

until it is broken or the spell is dispelled or suppressed. 
Casting knock on the object suppresses arcane lock for 
10 minutes. 

While affected by this spell, the object is more difficult 
to break or force open; the DC to break it or pick any 
locks on it increases by 10. 


ASTRAL PROJECTION 
9th-level necromancy 


Casting Time: 1 hour 

Range: 10 feet 

Components: V, S, M (for each creature you affect with 
this spell, you must provide one jacinth worth at least 
1,000 gp and one ornately carved bar of silver worth at 
least 100 gp, all of which the spell consumes) 

Duration: Special 


You and up to eight willing creatures within range proj- 
ect your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the spell 
fails and the casting is wasted if you are already on that 
plane). The material body you leave behind is uncon- 
scious and in a state of suspended animation; it doesn’t 
need food or air and doesn’t age. 

Your astral body resembles your mortal form in almost 
every way, replicating your game statistics and posses- 
sions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery 
cord that extends from between your shoulder blades and 
trails behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot. This 
cord is your tether to your material body. As long as the 
tether remains intact, you can find your way home. If the 
cord is cut—something that can happen only when an 
effect specifically states that it does—your soul and body 
are separated, killing you instantly. 

Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral 
Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any 
other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the plane 
you were on when casting this spell, your body and pos- 
sessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing 
you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane. Your 
astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage or other 
effects that apply to it have no effect on your physical body, 
nor do they persist when you return to it. 

The spell ends for you and your companions when 
you use your action to dismiss it. When the spell ends, 
the affected creature returns to its physical body, and 
it awakens. 

The spell might also end early for you or one of your 
companions. A successful dispel magic spell used against 
an astral or physical body ends the spell for that creature. 
If a creature’s original body or its astral form drops to 
0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If the spell 
ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the 
creature’s astral form back to its body, ending its state of 
suspended animation. 

If you are returned to your body prematurely, your com- 
panions remain in their astral forms and must find their 
own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping to 0 
hit points. 


AUGURY 
2nd-level divination (ritual) 


Casting Time: 1 minute 

Range: Self 

Components: V, S, M (specially marked sticks, bones, or 
similar tokens worth at least 25 gp) 

Duration: Instantaneous 


By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying 
out ornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, 
you receive an omen from an otherworldly entity about 
the results of a specific course of action that you plan to 
take within the next 30 minutes. The DM chooses from 
the following possible omens: 


Weal, for good results 

Woe, for bad results 

Weal and woe, for both good and bad results 
Nothing, for results that aren’t especially good or bad 


The spell doesn’t take into account any possible cir- 
cumstances that might change the outcome, such as 
the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a 
companion. 

If you cast the spell two or more times before complet- 
ing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent 
chance for each casting after the first that you get a ran- 
dom reading. The DM makes this roll in secret.

Casting Time: 1 action 

Range: 30 feet 

Components: V, S

saving throws, and regains the maximum number of hit

BLADE BARRIER 
6th-level evocation 


Casting Time: 1 action 

Range: 90 feet 

Components: V, S 

Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes 


You create a vertical wall of whirling, razor-sharp blades 
made of magical energy. The wall appears within range 
and lasts for the duration. You can make a straight wall 
up to 100 feet long, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick, or a 
ringed wall up to 60 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 5 
feet thick. The wall provides three-quarters cover to crea- 
tures behind it, and its space is difficult terrain. 

When a creature enters the wall’s area for the first time 
on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must make 
a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature 
takes 6d10 slashing damage. On a successful save, the 
creature takes half as much damage.

tional creature for each slot level above Ist.

Range: Self 

Components: V 

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute 


Your body becomes blurred, shifting and wavering to 

all who can see you. For the duration, any creature has

Ist-level evocation 


Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Self (15-foot cone) 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Instantaneous 


As you hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers 
spread, a thin sheet of flames shoots forth from your out- 
stretched fingertips. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must 
make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire 
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage ona 
successful one. 

The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that 
aren’t being worn or carried.

spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 
1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

Casting Time: 1 action 

Range: 150 feet 

Components: V, S, M (a bit of fur; a piece of amber, glass, 
or acrystal rod; and three silver pins) 

Duration: Instantaneous 


You create a bolt of lightning that arcs toward a target of 
your choice that you can see within range. Three bolts 
then leap from that target to as many as three other 
targets, each of which must be within 30 feet of the first 
target. A target can be a creature or an object and can be 
targeted by only one of the bolts. 

A target must make a Dexterity saving throw. The tar- 
get takes 10d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half 
as much damage on a successful one. 


At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 7th level or higher, one additional bolt leaps 
from the first target to another target for each slot level 
above 6th. 


CHARM PERSON 
Ist-level enchantment 


Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 30 feet 
Components: V, S 
Duration: 1 hour 


You attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within 
range. It must make a Wisdom saving throw, and does so 
with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. 
If it fails the saving throw, it is charmed by you until the 
spell ends or until you or your companions do anything 
harmful to it. The charmed creature regards you as a 
friendly acquaintance. When the spell ends, the creature 
knows it was charmed by you. 

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using 
a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one 
additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The 
creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you 
target them. 


COMMAND 
Ist-level enchantment 


Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 60 feet 
Components: V 
Duration: 1 round 


You speak a one-word command to a creature you can 
see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom 
saving throw or follow the command on its next turn. 
The spell has no effect if the target is undead, if it doesn’t 
understand your language, or if your command is directly 
harmful to it. 

Some typical commands and their effects follow. You 
might issue a command other than one described here. If 
you do so, the DM determines how the target behaves. If 
the target can’t follow your command, the spell ends. 

Approach. The target moves toward you by the short- 
est and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves 
within 5 feet of you. 

Drop. The target drops whatever it is holding and then 
ends its turn. 

Flee. The target spends its turn moving away from you 
by the fastest available means. 

Grovel. The target falls prone and then ends its turn. 
Halt. The target doesn’t move and takes no actions. A 
flying creature stays aloft, provided that it is able to do so. 
If it must move to stay aloft, it flies the minimum distance 

needed to remain in the air. 

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using 
a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect one 
additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The 
creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you 
target them.

COMMUNE 
5th-level divination (ritual) 


Casting Time: 1 minute

Components: V, S, M (incense and a vial of holy or 
unholy water) 

Duration: 1 minute 


You contact your deity or a divine proxy and ask up to 
three questions that can be answered with a yes or no. 
You must ask your questions before the spell ends. You 
receive a correct answer for each question. 

Divine beings aren't necessarily omniscient, so you 
might receive “unclear” as an answer if a question 
pertains to information that lies beyond the deity’s 
knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could be 
misleading or contrary to the deity’s interests, the DM 
might offer a short phrase as an answer instead. 

If you cast the spell two or more times before finish- 
ing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent 
chance for each casting after the first that you get no an- 
swer. The DM makes this roll in secret.

any spoken language that you hear. You also understand 
any written language that you see, but you must be touch- 
ing the surface on which the words are written. It takes

Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when you see a 
creature within 60 feet of you casting a spell 

Range: 60 feet 


Components: S 
Duration: Instantaneous 


You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of cast- 
ing a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level 
or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a 
spell of 4th level or higher, make an ability check using 
your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s 
level. On a success, the creature’s spell fails and has 

no effect. 

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 4th level or higher, the interrupted spell has 
no effect if its level is less than or equal to the level of the 
spell slot you used. 


CuRE WOUNDS 
1st-level evocation 


Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Touch 
Components: V, S

to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has

1d8 for each slot level above 1st. 


DANCING LIGHTS 
Evocation cantrip 


Casting Time: 1 action 

Range: 120 feet 

Components: V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus or wychwood, 
or a glowworm) 

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute 


You create up to four torch-sized lights within range, 
making them appear as torches, lanterns, or glowing 
orbs that hover in the air for the duration. You can also 
combine the four lights into one glowing vaguely human- 
oid form of Medium size. Whichever form you choose, 
each light sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. 

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights 
up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must be 
within 20 feet of another light created by this spell, and a

piece of coal) 

Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes 


Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose 
within range to fill a 15-foot-radius sphere for the dura- 
tion. The darkness spreads around corners. A creature 
with darkvision can’t see through this darkness, and non- 
magical light can’t illuminate it. 

If the point you choose is on an object you are holding 
or one that isn’t being worn or carried, the darkness 
emanates from the object and moves with it. Completely

covering the source of the darkness with an opaque ob- 
ject, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the darkness. 

If any of this spell’s area overlaps with an area of light 
created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that cre- 
ated the light is dispelled. 


DEATH WARD 
4th-level abjuration 


Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Touch 
Components: V, S 
Duration: 8 hours 


You touch a creature and grant it a measure of protection 
from death. 

The first time the target would drop to 0 hit points asa 
result of taking damage, the target instead drops to 1 hit 
point, and the spell ends. 

If the spell is still in effect when the target is subjected 
to an effect that would kill it instantaneously without 
dealing damage, that effect is instead negated against the 
target, and the spell ends. 


DELAYED BLAST FIREBALL 
7th-level evocation 


Casting Time: 1 action 

Range: 150 feet 

Components: V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur) 
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute 


A beam of yellow light flashes from your pointing finger, 
then condenses to linger at a chosen point within range 
as a glowing bead for the duration. When the spell ends, 
either because your concentration is broken or because 
you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a low roar 
into an explosion of flame that spreads around corners. 
Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on 
that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A crea- 
ture takes fire damage equal to the total accumulated 
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage ona 
successful one. 

The spell’s base damage is 12d6. If at the end of your 
turn the bead has not yet detonated, the damage in- 
creases by 1d6. 

If the glowing bead is touched before the interval has 
expired, the creature touching it must make a Dexterity 
saving throw. On a failed save, the spell ends immedi- 
ately, causing the bead to erupt in flame. On a successful 
save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet. When 
it strikes a creature or a solid object, the spell ends, and 
the bead explodes. 

The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flam- 
mable objects that aren’t being worn or carried. 

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using 
a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the base damage in- 
creases by 1d6 for each slot level above 7th. 


DETECT MAGIC 
1st-level divination (ritual) 


Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Self 


Components: V, S 
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes 


For the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 
30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use 
your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature 
or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its 
school of magic, if any. 

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked 
by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of 
lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt. 


DIMENSION DOOR 
4th-level conjuration 


Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 500 feet 
Components: V 
Duration: Instantaneous 


You teleport yourself from your current location to any 
other spot within range. You arrive at exactly the spot de- 
sired. It can be a place you can see, one you can visualize, 
or one you can describe by stating distance and direction, 
such as “200 feet straight downward” or “upward to the 
northwest at a 45-degree angle, 300 feet.” 

You can bring along objects as long as their weight 
doesn’t exceed what you can carry. You can also bring 
one willing creature of your size or smaller who is carry- 
ing gear up to its carrying capacity. The creature must be 
within 5 feet of you when you cast this spell. 

If you would arrive in a place already occupied by an 
object or a creature, you and any creature traveling with 
you each take 4d6 force damage, and the spell fails to 
teleport you. 


DISGUISE SELF 
Ist-level illusion 


Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Self 
Components: V, S 
Duration: 1 hour 


You make yourself—including your clothing, armor, weap- 
ons, and other belongings on your person—look different 
until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss 
it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear 
thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change your body type, 
so you must adopt a form that has the same basic ar- 
rangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion 
is up to you. 

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to 
physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to 
add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and 
anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel 
your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner 
than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to 
touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly 
still in midair. 

To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use 
its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed 
on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your 
spell save DC.

DISINTEGRATE 
6th-level transmutation 


Casting Time: 1 action 

Range: 60 feet 

Components: V, S, M (a lodestone and a pinch of dust) 
Duration: Instantaneous 


A thin green ray springs from your pointing finger to a 
target that you can see within range. The target can be a 
creature, an object, or a creation of magical force, such as 
the wall created by wail of force. 

A creature targeted by this spell must make a Dexterity 
saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 10d6 + 40 
force damage. The target is disintegrated if this damage 
leaves it with 0 hit points. 

A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing 
and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of 
fine gray dust. The creature can be restored to life only by 
means of a true resurrection or a wish spell. 

This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or 
smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. 
If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of force, 
this spell disintegrates a 10-foot-cube portion of it. A 
magic item is unaffected by this spell. 

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 
3d6 for each slot level above 6th. 


DISPEL MAGIC 
3rd-level abjuration 


Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 120 feet 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Instantaneous 


Choose one creature, object, or magical effect within 
range. Any spell of 3rd level or lower on the target ends. 
For each spell of 4th level or higher on the target, make 
an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC 
equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a successful check, the 
spell ends. 

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 4th level or higher, you automatically end the 
effects of a spell on the target if the spell’s level is equal to 
or less than the level of the spell slot you used. 


DIVINATION 
4th-level divination (ritual) 


Casting Time: 1 action 

Range: Self 

Components: V, S, M (incense and a sacrificial offering 
appropriate to your religion, together worth at least 25 
gp, which the spell consumes) 

Duration: Instantaneous 


Your magic and an offering put you in contact with a god 
or a god’s servants. You ask a single question concerning 
a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 7 days. 
The DM offers a truthful reply. The reply might be a short 
phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen. 

The spell doesn’t take into account any possible cir- 
cumstances that might change the outcome, such as 
the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a 
companion. 


If you cast the spell two or more times before finish- 
ing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent 
chance for each casting after the first that you get a ran- 
dom reading. The DM makes this roll in secret. 


DOMINATE MONSTER 
S8th-level enchantment 


Casting Time: 1 action 

Range: 60 feet 

Components: V, S 

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour 


You attempt to beguile a creature that you can see within 
range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be 
charmed by you for the duration. If you or creatures that 
are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the 
saving throw. 

While the creature is charmed, you have a telepathic 
link with it as long as the two of you are on the same 
plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link to 
issue commands to the creature while you are conscious 
(no action required), which it does its best to obey. You 
can specify a simple and general course of action, such 
as “Attack that creature,” “Run over there,” or “Fetch that 
object.” If the creature completes the order and doesn’t 
receive further direction from you, it defends and pre- 
serves itself to the best of its ability. 

You can use your action to take total and precise con- 
trol of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the 
creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn’t 
do anything that you don’t allow it to do. During this time, 
you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this 
requires you to use your own reaction as well. 

Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new 
Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving 
throw succeeds, the spell ends. 

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell with a 
9th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up 
to 8 hours. 


DOMINATE PERSON 
5th-level enchantment 


Casting Time: 1 action 

Range: 60 feet 

Components: V, S 

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute 


You attempt to beguile a humanoid that you can see 
within range. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw 
or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or creatures 
that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on 
the saving throw. 

While the target is charmed, you have a telepathic link 
with it as long as the two of you are on the same plane of 
existence. You can use this telepathic link to issue com- 
mands to the creature while you are conscious (no action

You can use your action to take total and precise con- 
trol of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the 
creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn’t 
do anything that you don’t allow it to do. During this time 
you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
6th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 10 
minutes. When you use a 7th-level spell slot, the duration 
is concentration, up to 1 hour. When you use a spell slot 
of 8th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up 
to 8 hours. 


DREAM 
5th-level illusion 


Casting Time: 1 minute 

Range: Special 

Components: V, S, M (a handful of sand, a dab of ink, 
and a writing quill plucked from a sleeping bird) 

Duration: 8 hours 


This spell shapes a creature’s dreams. Choose a creature 
known to you as the target of this spell. The target must 
be on the same plane of existence as you. Creatures that 
don’t sleep, such as elves, can’t be contacted by this spell. 
You, or a willing creature you touch, enters a trance state, 
acting as a messenger. While in the trance, the messen- 
ger is aware of his or her surroundings, but can’t take 
actions or move. 

If the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the 
target’s dreams and can converse with the target as long 
as it remains asleep, through the duration of the spell. 
The messenger can also shape the environment of the 
dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other images. 
The messenger can emerge from the trance at any time, 
ending the effect of the spell early. The target recalls the 
dream perfectly upon waking. If the target is awake when 
you cast the spell, the messenger knows it, and can either 
end the trance (and the spell) or wait for the target to fall 
asleep, at which point the messenger appears in the tar- 
get’s dreams. 

You can make the messenger appear monstrous and 
terrifying to the target. If you do, the messenger can de- 
liver a message of no more than ten words and then the 
target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed 
save, echoes of the phantasmal monstrosity spawn a 
nightmare that lasts the duration of the target’s sleep and 
prevents the target from gaining any benefit from that 
rest. In addition, when the target wakes up, it takes 3d6 
psychic damage. 

If you have a body part, lock of hair, clipping from a 
nail, or similar portion of the target’s body, the target 
makes its saving throw with disadvantage. 


EARTHQUAKE 
8th-level evocation 


Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 500 feet 


Components: V, S, M (a pinch of dirt, a piece of rock, and 
a lump of clay) 
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute 


You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground 
that you can see within range. For the duration, an in- 
tense tremor rips through the ground in a 100-foot-radius 
circle centered on that point and shakes creatures and 
structures in contact with the ground in that area. 

The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain. Each 
creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a 
Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature’s 
concentration is broken. 

When you cast this spell and at the end of each turn 
you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the 
ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. 
On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone. 

This spell can have additional effects depending on the 
terrain in the area, as determined by the DM. 

Fissures. Fissures open throughout the spell’s area at 
the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. A total 
of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the DM. 
Each is 1d10 x 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends 
from one edge of the spell’s area to the opposite side. A 
creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens must 
succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fallin. A creature 
that successfully saves moves with the fissure’s edge 
as it opens. 

A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to 
automatically collapse (see below). 

Structures. The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage 
to any structure in contact with the ground in the area 
when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your 
turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit 
points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby crea- 
tures. A creature within half the distance of a structure’s 
height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed 
save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is 
knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a 
DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. 
The DM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on 
the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the crea- 
ture takes half as much damage and doesn’t fall prone or 
become buried. 


ETHEREALNESS 
7th-level transmutation 


Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Self 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Up to 8 hours 


You step into the border regions of the Ethereal Plane, in 
the area where it overlaps with your current plane. You 
remain in the Border Ethereal for the duration or until 
you use your action to dismiss the spell. During this time, 
you can move in any direction. If you move up or down, 
every foot of movement costs an extra foot. You can see 
and hear the plane you originated from, but everything 
there looks gray, and you can’t see anything more than 
60 feet away. 

While on the Ethereal Plane, you can only affect and be 
affected by other creatures on that plane. Creatures that 
aren't on the Ethereal Plane can’t perceive you and can’t

interact with you, unless a special ability or magic has 
given them the ability to do so. 

You ignore all objects and effects that aren’t on the 
Ethereal Plane, allowing you to move through objects you 
perceive on the plane you originated from. 

When the spell ends, you immediately return to the 
plane you originated from in the spot you currently 
occupy. If you occupy the same spot as a solid object 
or creature when this happens, you are immediately 
shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you can oc- 
cupy and take force damage equal to twice the number of 
feet you are moved. 

This spell has no effect if you cast it while you are on 
the Ethereal Plane or a plane that doesn’t border it, such 
as one of the Outer Planes. 

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 8th level or higher, you can target up to three 
willing creatures (including you) for each slot level above 
7th. The creatures must be within 10 feet of you when 
you cast the spell. 


FIND THE PATH 
6th-level divination 


Casting Time: 1 minute 

Range: Self 

Components: V, S, M (a set of divinatory tools—such

wish to find) 

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 day 


This spell allows you to find the shortest, most direct 
physical route to a specific fixed location that you are 
familiar with on the same plane of existence. If you name 
a destination on another plane of existence, a destination 
that moves (such as a mobile fortress), or a destination 
that isn’t specific (Such as “a green dragon’s lair”), the 
spell fails. 

For the duration, as long as you are on the same plane 
of existence as the destination, you know how far it is and 
in what direction it lies. While you are traveling there, 
whenever you are presented with a choice of paths along 
the way, you automatically determine which path is the 
shortest and most direct route (but not necessarily the 
safest route) to the destination.

Range: 60 feet

blue, green, or violet light (your choice). Any creature in 
the area when the spell is cast is also outlined in light if 
it fails a Dexterity saving throw. For the duration, objects 
and affected creatures shed dim light in a 10-foot radius. 
Any attack roll against an affected creature or object 

has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected 
creature or object can’t benefit from being invisible.

its ability.

tion. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the 
sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature 
takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much 
damage on a successful one. 

As a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 30 
feet. If you ram the sphere into a creature, that creature

age, and the sphere stops moving this turn. 

When you move the sphere, you can direct it over bar- 
riers up to 5 feet tall and jump it across pits up to 10 feet

get’s movement is unaffected by difficult terrain, and 
spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the 
target’s speed nor cause the target to be paralyzed or 
restrained. 

The target can also spend 5 feet of movement to au- 
tomatically escape from nonmagical restraints, such as

portal in any direction you choose. The portal lasts for 
the duration. 

The portal has a front and a back on each plane where 
it appears. Travel through the portal is possible only by 
moving through its front. Anything that does so is in- 
stantly transported to the other plane, appearing in the 
unoccupied space nearest to the portal. 

Deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals 
created by this spell from opening in their presence or 
anywhere within their domains. 

When you cast this spell, you can speak the name of a 
specific creature (a pseudonym, title, or nickname doesn’t 
work). If that creature is on a plane other than the one 
you are on, the portal opens in the named creature’s im- 
mediate vicinity and draws the creature through it to the 


CHAPTER 11: SPELLS 











nearest unoccupied space on your side of the portal. You

if the spell is cast using a higher level spell slot. Such a 
spell can target creatures and objects within the barrier, 
but the spell has no effect on them. Similarly, the area 
within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by

If the target fails the saving throw, its hit point maximum

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M (a pearl worth at least 100 gp and 
an owl feather) 

Duration: Instantaneous

the casting of the spell. If it is a magic item or some other 
magic-imbued object, you learn its properties and how to 
use them, whether it requires attunement to use, and how 
many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any spells 
are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was 
created by a spell, you learn which spell created it. 

If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, 
you learn what spells, if any, are currently affecting it. 


IMPRISONMENT 
9th-level abjuration 


Casting Time: 1 minute 

Range: 30 feet 

Components: V, S, M (a vellum depiction or a carved 
statuette in the likeness of the target, and a special 
component that varies according to the version of the 
spell you choose, worth at least 500 gp per Hit Die 
of the target) 

Duration: Until dispelled 


You create a magical restraint to hold a creature that you 
can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wis- 
dom saving throw or be bound by the spell; if it succeeds, 
it is immune to this spell if you cast it again. While af- 
fected by this spell, the creature doesn’t need to breathe, 
eat, or drink, and it doesn’t age. Divination spells can’t 
locate or perceive the target. 

When you cast the spell, you choose one of the follow- 
ing forms of imprisonment. 

Burial. The target is entombed far beneath the earth in 
a sphere of magical force that is just large enough to con- 
tain the target. Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor 
can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get into 
or out of it. 

The special component for this version of the spell is a 
small mithral orb. 

Chaining. Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, 
hold the target in place. The target is restrained until the 
spell ends, and it can’t move or be moved by any means 
until then. 

The special component for this version of the spell isa 
fine chain of precious metal. 

Hedged Prison. The spell transports the target into a 
tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation and 
planar travel. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, 
a tower, or any similar confined structure or area of 
your choice. 

The special component for this version of the spell isa 
miniature representation of the prison made from jade. 

Minimus Containment. The target shrinks to a height 
of 1 inch and is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar 
object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally 
(allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see 


in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of 
teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can’t be cut 
or broken while the spell remains in effect. 

The special component for this version of the spell is 
a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, dia- 
mond, or ruby. 

Slumber. The target falls asleep and can’t be awoken. 
The special component for this version of the spell con- 
sists of rare soporific herbs. 

Ending the Spell. During the casting of the spell, in 
any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will 
cause the spell to end and release the target. The con- 
dition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, 
but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable 
and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions 
can be based on a creature’s name, identity, or deity but 
otherwise must be based on observable actions or qual- 
ities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or 
hit points. 

A dispel magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast as 
a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special 
component used to create it. 

You can use a particular special component to create 
only one prison at a time. If you cast the spell again using 
the same component, the target of the first casting is im- 
mediately freed from its binding.

ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invis- 
ible as long as it is on the target’s person. The spell ends 
for a target that attacks or casts a spell. 

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one addi- 
tional creature for each slot level above 2nd.

padlock, or another object that contains a mundane or 
magical means that prevents access. 

A target that is held shut by a mundane lock or that 
is stuck or barred becomes unlocked, unstuck, or un- 
barred. If the object has multiple locks, only one of them 
is unlocked. 

If you choose a target that is held shut with arcane Iock, 
that spell is suppressed for 10 minutes, during which 
time the target can be opened and shut normally. 

When you cast the spell, a loud knock, audible from as 
far away as 300 feet, emanates from the target object. 


LESSER RESTORATION 
2nd-level abjuration 


Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Touch 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Instantaneous 


You touch a creature and can end either one disease or 
one condition afflicting it. The condition can be blinded, 
deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned. 


LEVITATE 
2nd-level transmutation 


Casting Time: 1 action 

Range: 60 feet 

Components: V, S, M (either a small leather loop or a 
piece of golden wire bent into a cup shape with a long 
shank on one end) 

Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes 


One creature or loose object of your choice that you 
can see within range rises vertically, up to 20 feet, and 
remains suspended there for the duration. The spell 
can levitate a target that weighs up to 500 pounds. An 
unwilling creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving 
throw is unaffected. 

The target can move only by pushing or pulling against 
a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or 
a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. 
You can change the target’s altitude by up to 20 feet in 
either direction on your turn. If you are the target, you 
can move up or down as part of your move. Otherwise, 
you can use your action to move the target, which must 
remain within the spell’s range. 

When the spell ends, the target floats gently to the 
ground if it is still aloft. 


LIGHT 
Evocation cantrip 


Casting Time: 1 action 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, M (a firefly or phosphorescent moss) 
Duration: 1 hour 


You touch one object that is no larger than 10 feet in any 
dimension. Until the spell ends, the object sheds bright 
light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 
20 feet. The light can be colored as you like. Completely 
covering the object with something opaque blocks the 
light. The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as 
an action. 


If you target an object held or worn by a hostile crea- 
ture, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving 
throw to avoid the spell. 


LIGHTNING BOLT 
3rd-level evocation 


Casting Time: 1 action 

Range: Self (100-foot line) 

Components: V, S, M (a bit of fur and a rod of amber, 
crystal, or glass) 

Duration: Instantaneous 


A stroke of lightning forming a line 100 feet long and 5 
feet wide blasts out from you in a direction you choose. 
Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving 
throw. A creature takes 8d6 lightning damage on a failed 
save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

The lightning ignites flammable objects in the area that 
aren’t being worn or carried. 

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 
1d6 for each slot level above 3rd. 


LOCATE CREATURE 
4th-level divination 


Casting Time: 1 action 

Range: Self 

Components: V, S, M (a bit of fur from a bloodhound) 
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour 


Describe or name a creature that is familiar to you. You 
sense the direction to the creature’s location, as long as 
that creature is within 1,000 feet of you. If the creature is 
moving, you know the direction of its movement. 

The spell can locate a specific creature known to 
you, or the nearest creature of a specific kind (such as 
a human or a unicorn), so long as you have seen such a 
creature up close—within 30 feet—at least once. If the 
creature you described or named is in a different form, 
such as being under the effects of a polymorph spell, this 
spell doesn’t locate the creature. 

This spell can’t locate a creature if running water at 
least 10 feet wide blocks a direct path between you and 
the creature. 


MAGE ARMOR 
1st-level abjuration 


Casting Time: 1 action 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M (a piece of cured leather) 
Duration: 8 hours 


You touch a willing creature who isn’t wearing armor, 
and a protective magical force surrounds it until the spell 
ends. The target’s base AC becomes 13 + its Dexterity 
modifier. The spell ends if the target dons armor or if you 
dismiss the spell as an action. 


MAGE HAND 
Conjuration cantrip 


Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 30 feet 


CHAPTER 11: SPELLS

Components: V, S 
Duration: 1 minute 


A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose 
within range. The hand lasts for the duration or until 
you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is 
ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this 
spell again. 

You can use your action to control the hand. You can 
use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked 
door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open 
container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can 
move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it. 

The hand can’t attack, activate magic items, or carry 
more than 10 pounds. 


MacIc MISSILE 
Ist-level evocation 


Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 120 feet 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Instantaneous 


You create three glowing darts of magical force. Each 
dart hits a creature of your choice that you can see within 
range. A dart deals 1d4 + 1 force damage to its target. 
The darts all strike simultaneously, and you can direct 
them to hit one creature or several. 

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the spell creates one 
more dart for each slot level above 1st. 


Macic WEAPON 
2nd-level transmutation 


Casting Time: 1 bonus action 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S 

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour 


You touch a nonmagical weapon. Until the spell ends, 
that weapon becomes a magic weapon with a +1 bonus to 
attack rolls and damage rolls. 

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 4th level or higher, the bonus increases to +2. 
When you use a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the bonus 
increases to +3. 


Major IMAGE 
3rd-level illusion 


Casting Time: 1 action 

Range: 120 feet 

Components: V, S, M (a bit of fleece) 
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes 


You create the image of an object, a creature, or some 
other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20- 
foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see 
within range and lasts for the duration. It seems com- 
pletely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature 
appropriate to the thing depicted. You can’t create suffi- 
cient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough 
to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell 
that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte’s stench). 
As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can 
use your action to cause the image to move to any other 


spot within range. As the image changes location, you 
can alter its appearance so that its movements appear 
natural for the image. For example, if you create an im- 
age of acreature and move it, you can alter the image so 
that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the 
illusion to make different sounds at different times, even 
making it carry on a conversation, for example. 

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an 
illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature 
that uses its action to examine the image can determine 
that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Inves- 
tigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature 
discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see 
through the image, and its other sensory qualities be- 
come faint to the creature. 

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell lasts until dis- 
pelled, without requiring your concentration. 


MAss CURE WOUNDS 
5th-level evocation 


Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 60 feet 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Instantaneous 


A wave of healing energy washes out from a point of 
your choice within range. Choose up to six creatures 
in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each 
target regains hit points equal to 3d8 + your spellcasting 
ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or 
constructs. 

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 6th level or higher, the healing increases by 
1d8 for each slot level above 5th. 


MAss HEAL 
9th-level evocation 


Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 60 feet 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Instantaneous 


A flood of healing energy flows from you into injured 
creatures around you. You restore up to 700 hit points, di- 
vided as you choose among any number of creatures that 
you can see within range. Creatures healed by this spell 
are also cured of all diseases and any effect making them 
blinded or deafened. This spell has no effect on undead 
or constructs.

1d4 for each slot level above 3rd. 


Mass SUGGESTION 
6th-level enchantment 


Casting Time: 1 action 

Range: 60 feet 

Components: V, M (a snake’s tongue and either a bit of 
honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil) 

Duration: 24 hours 


You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence 

or two) and magically influence up to twelve creatures 

of your choice that you can see within range and that 

can hear and understand you. Creatures that can’t be 
charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must 
be worded in such a manner as to make the course of 
action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab it- 
self, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some 
other obviously harmful act automatically negates the 
effect of the spell. 

Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a 
failed save, it pursues the course of action you described 
to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action 
can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested ac- 
tivity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends 
when the subject finishes what it was asked to do. 

You can also specify conditions that will trigger a spe- 
cial activity during the duration. For example, you might 
suggest that a group of soldiers give all their money to the 
first beggar they meet. If the condition isn’t met before 
the spell ends, the activity isn’t performed. 

If you or any of your companions damage a creature 
affected by this spell, the spell ends for that creature. 

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 7th- 
level spell slot, the duration is 10 days. When you use an 
8th-level spell slot, the duration is 30 days. When you use 
a 9th-level spell slot, the duration is a year and a day. 


MAZE 
Sth-level conjuration 


Casting Time: 1 action 

Range: 60 feet 

Components: V, S 

Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes 


You banish a creature that you can see within range into 
a labyrinthine demiplane. The target remains there for 
the duration or until it escapes the maze. 

The target can use its action to attempt to escape. 
When it does so, it makes a DC 20 Intelligence check. If 
it succeeds, it escapes, and the spell ends (a minotaur or 
goristro demon automatically succeeds). 

When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space 
it left or, if that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccu- 
pied space. 


METEOR SWARM 
9th-level evocation 


Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 1 mile 


Components: V, S 
Duration: Instantaneous 


Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four differ- 
ent points you can see within range. Each creature in a 
40-foot-radius sphere centered on each point you choose 
must make a Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads 
around corners. A creature takes 20d6 fire damage and 
20d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as 
much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area 
of more than one fiery burst is affected only once. 

The spell damages objects in the area and ignites flam- 
mable objects that aren’t being worn or carried. 


MINOR ILLUSION 
Iilusion cantrip 


Casting Time: 1 action 

Range: 30 feet 

Components: S, M (a bit of fleece) 
Duration: 1 minute 


You create a sound or an image of an object within range 
that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if you 
dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again. 

If you create a sound, its volume can range from a 
whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else’s 
voice, a lion’s roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound 
you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout 
the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different 
times before the spell ends. 

If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, 
muddy footprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger 
than a 5-foot cube. The image can’t create sound, light, 
smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction 
with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things 
can pass through it. 

If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or im- 
age, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with 
a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against 
your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for 
what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature. 


MIstTy STEP 
2nd-level conjuration 


Casting Time: 1 bonus action 
Range: Self 

Components: V 

Duration: Instantaneous 


Briefly surrounded by silvery mist, you teleport up to 30 
feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. 


MORDENKAINEN’S SWORD 
7th-level evocation 


Casting Time: 1 action 

Range: 60 feet 

Components: V, S, M (a miniature platinum sword with a 
grip and pommel of copper and zinc, worth 250 gp) 

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute 


You create a sword-shaped plane of force that hovers 
within range. It lasts for the duration. 

When the sword appears, you make a melee spell at- 
tack against a target of your choice within 5 feet of the 
sword. Ona hit, the target takes 3d10 force damage.

Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each 
of your turns to move the sword up to 20 feet to a spot 
you can see and repeat this attack against the same tar- 
get or a different one. 


OTTO’S IRRESISTIBLE DANCE 
6th-level enchantment 


Casting Time: 1 action 

Range: 30 feet 

Components: V 

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute 


Choose one creature that you can see within range. The 
target begins a comic dance in place: shuffling, tapping 
its feet, and capering for the duration. Creatures that 
can’t be charmed are immune to this spell. 

A dancing creature must use all its movement to dance 
without leaving its space and has disadvantage on Dex- 
terity saving throws and attack rolls. While the target is 
affected by this spell, other creatures have advantage on 
attack rolls against it. As an action, a dancing creature 
makes a Wisdom saving throw to regain control of itself. 
On a successful save, the spell ends. 


PASSWALL 
5th-level transmutation 


Casting Time: 1 action 

Range: 30 feet 

Components: V, S, M (a pinch of sesame seeds) 
Duration: | hour 


A passage appears at a point of your choice that you can 
see on a wooden, plaster, or stone surface (such as a wall, 
a ceiling, or a floor) within range, and lasts for the dura- 
tion. You choose the opening’s dimensions: up to 5 feet 
wide, 8 feet tall, and 20 feet deep. The passage creates no 
instability in a structure surrounding it. 

When the opening disappears, any creatures or objects 
still in the passage created by the spell are safely ejected 
to an unoccupied space nearest to the surface on which 
you cast the spell. 


POISON SPRAY 
Conjuration cantrip 


Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 10 feet 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Instantaneous 


You extend your hand toward a creature you can see 
within range and project a puff of noxious gas from your 
palm. The creature must succeed on a Constitution sav- 
ing throw or take 1d12 poison damage. 

This spell’s damage increases by 1d12 when you reach 
5th level (2d12), 11th level (3d12), and 17th level (4d12). 


POWER WorD KILL 
9th-level enchantment 


Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 60 feet 


Components: V 
Duration: Instantaneous 


You utter a word of power that can compel one creature 
you can see within range to die instantly. If the creature 
you choose has 100 hit points or fewer, it dies. Otherwise, 
the spell has no effect. 


POWER WORD STUN 
Sth-level enchantment 


Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 60 feet 
Components: V 
Duration: Instantaneous 


You speak a word of power that can overwhelm the mind 
of one creature you can see within range, leaving it dumb- 
founded. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it is 
stunned. Otherwise, the spell has no effect. 

The stunned target must make a Constitution saving 
throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful 
save, this stunning effect ends. 


PRAYER OF HEALING 
2nd-level evocation 


Casting Time: 10 minutes 
Range: 30 feet 
Components: V 
Duration: Instantaneous 


Up to six creatures of your choice that you can see within

ing ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or 
constructs. 

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the healing increases by 
1d8 for each slot level above 2nd. 


PRESTIDIGITATION 
Transmutation cantrip 


Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 10 feet 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Up to 1 hour 


This spell is a minor magical trick that novice 
spellcasters use for practice. You create one of the 
following magical effects within range: 


« You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, 
such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical 
notes, or an odd odor. 

- You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, 
or a small campfire. 

- You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger 
than 1 cubic foot.

material for 1 hour. 

« You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on 
an object or a surface for 1 hour.

your next turn.

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to 
three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and 
you can dismiss such an effect as an action. 


PROTECTION FROM ENERGY 
3rd-level abjuration 


Casting Time: 1 action 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S 

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour 


For the duration, the willing creature you touch has resis- 
tance to one damage type of your choice: acid, cold, fire, 
lightning, or thunder. 


RAISE DEAD 
5th-level necromancy 


Casting Time: 1 hour 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 500 gp, 
which the spell consumes) 

Duration: Instantaneous 


You return a dead creature you touch to life, provided that 
it has been dead no longer than 10 days. If the creature’s 
soul is both willing and at liberty to rejoin the body, the 
creature returns to life with 1 hit point. 

This spell also neutralizes any poisons and cures 
nonmagical diseases that affected the creature at the 
time it died. This spell doesn’t, however, remove magical 
diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren't first re- 
moved prior to casting the spell, they take effect when the 
creature returns to life. The spell can’t return an undead 
creature to life. 

This spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn’t re- 
store missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body 
parts or organs integral for its survival—its head, for in- 
stance—the spell automatically fails. 

Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target 
takes a —4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and 
ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, 
the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears. 


RAY OF FROST 
Evocation cantrip 


Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 60 feet 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Instantaneous 


A frigid beam of blue-white light streaks toward a crea- 
ture within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the 
target. On a hit, it takes 1d8 cold damage, and its speed is 
reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. 

The spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 
5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8). 


REGENERATE 
7th-level transmutation 


Casting Time: 1 minute 
Range: Touch 


Components: V, S, M (a prayer wheel and holy water) 
Duration: 1 hour 


You touch a creature and stimulate its natural healing 
ability. The target regains 4d8 + 15 hit points. For the 
duration of the spell, the target regains 1 hit point at the 
start of each of its turns (10 hit points each minute). 

The target’s severed body members (fingers, legs, tails, 
and so on), if any, are restored after 2 minutes. If you 
have the severed part and hold it to the stump, the spell 
instantaneously causes the limb to knit to the stump. 


REMOVE CURSE 
3rd-level abjuration 


Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Touch 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Instantaneous 


At your touch, all curses affecting one creature or object 
end. If the object is a cursed magic item, its curse re- 
mains, but the spell breaks its owner’s attunement to the 
object so it can be removed or discarded. 


RESISTANCE 
Abjuration cantrip 


Casting Time: 1 action 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M (a miniature cloak) 
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute 


You touch one willing creature. Once before the spell 
ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled 
to one saving throw of its choice. It can roll the die before 
or after making the saving throw. The spell then ends. 


RESURRECTION 
7th-level necromancy 


Casting Time: 1 hour 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 1,000 gp, 
which the spell consumes) 

Duration: Instantaneous 


You touch a dead creature that has been dead for no more 
than a century, that didn’t die of old age, and that isn’t 
undead. If its soul is free and willing, the target returns to 
life with all its hit points. 

This spell neutralizes any poisons and cures normal 
diseases afflicting the creature when it died. It doesn’t, 
however, remove magical diseases, curses, and the like; if 
such effects aren’t removed prior to casting the spell, they 
afflict the target on its return to life. 

This spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any 
missing body parts. 

Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target 
takes a —4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and 
ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, 
the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears. 

Casting this spell to restore life to a creature that has 
been dead for one year or longer taxes you greatly. Until 
you finish a long rest, you can’t cast spells again, and you 
have disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and 
saving throws.

Casting Time: 1 action 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M (diamonds worth 300 gp, which the 
spell consumes) 

Duration: Instantaneous 


You touch a creature that has died within the last minute. 
That creature returns to life with 1 hit point. This spell 
can’t return to life a creature that has died of old age, nor 
can it restore any missing body parts. 


SACRED FLAME 
Evocation cantrip 


Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 60 feet 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Instantaneous 


Flame-like radiance descends on a creature that you can 
see within range. The target must succeed on a Dexterity 
saving throw or take 1d8 radiant damage. The target 
gains no benefit from cover for this saving throw. 

The spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 
5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8). 


SANCTUARY 
Ist-level abjuration 


Casting Time: 1 bonus action 

Range: 30 feet 

Components: V, S, M (a small silver mirror) 
Duration: 1 minute 


You ward a creature within range against attack. Until 
the spell ends, any creature who targets the warded crea- 
ture with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a 
Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must 
choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell 
doesn’t protect the warded creature from area effects, 
such as the explosion of a fireball. 

If the warded creature makes an attack, casts a spell 
that affects an enemy, or deals damage to another crea- 
ture, this spell ends. 


SHATTER 
2nd-level evocation 


Casting Time: 1 action 

Range: 60 feet 

Components: V, S, M (a chip of mica) 
Duration: Instantaneous 


A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts 
from a point of your choice within range. Each creature 
in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must 
make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 
thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage 
on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic mate- 
rial such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on 
this saving throw. 

A nonmagical object that isn’t being worn or carried 
also takes the damage if it’s in the spell’s area. 


At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 
1d8 for each slot level above 2nd. 


SHIELD 
1st-level abjuration 


Casting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when you are 
hit by an attack or targeted by the magic missile spell 

Range: Self 

Components: V, S 

Duration: 1 round 


An invisible barrier of magical force appears and protects 
you. Until the start of your next turn, you have a+5 bonus 
to AC, including against the triggering attack, and you 
take no damage from magic missile. 


SHIELD OF FAITH 
1st-level abjuration 


Casting Time: 1 bonus action 

Range: 60 feet 

Components: V, S, M (a small parchment with a bit of 
holy text written on it) 

Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes 


A shimmering field appears and surrounds a creature of 
your choice within range, granting it a +2 bonus to AC for 
the duration. 


SHOCKING GRASP 
Evocation cantrip 


Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Touch 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Instantaneous 


Lightning springs from your hand to deliver a shock to 
a creature you try to touch. Make a melee spell attack 
against the target. You have advantage on the attack roll 
if the target is wearing armor made of metal. On a hit, the 
target takes 1d8 lightning damage, and it can’t take reac- 
tions until the start of its next turn. 

The spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 
5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d 8). 


SILENCE 
2nd-level illusion (ritual) 


Casting Time: 1 action 

Range: 120 feet 

Components: V, S 

Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes 


For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass 
through a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you 
choose within range. Any creature or object entirely 
inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and 
creatures are deafened while entirely inside it. Casting 

a spell that includes a verbal component is impos- 

sible there. 


SILENT IMAGE 
1st-level illusion 


Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 60 feet 


CHAPTER 11: SPELLS 











Components: V, S, M (a bit of fleece) 
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes 


You create the image of an object, a creature, or some 
other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 15-foot 
cube. The image appears at a spot within range and lasts 
for the duration. The image is purely visual; it isn’t accom- 
panied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects. 

You can use your action to cause the image to move to 
any spot within range. As the image changes location, 
you can alter its appearance so that its movements ap- 
pear natural for the image. For example, if you create an 
image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image 
so that it appears to be walking. 

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an 
illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature 
that uses its action to examine the image can determine 
that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Inves- 
tigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature 
discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see 
through the image. 


SLEEP 
Ist-level enchantment 


Casting Time: 1 action 

Range: 90 feet 

Components: V, S, M (a pinch of fine sand, rose petals, 
or a cricket) 

Duration: 1 minute 


This spell sends creatures into a magical slumber. Roll 
5d8; the total is how many hit points of creatures this 
spell can affect. Creatures within 20 feet of a point you 
choose within range are affected in ascending order of 
their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures). 

Starting with the creature that has the lowest current 
hit points, each creature affected by this spell falls un- 
conscious until the spell ends, the sleeper takes damage, 
or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper 
awake. Subtract each creature’s hit points from the total 
before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit 
points. A creature’s hit points must be equal to or less 
than the remaining total for that creature to be affected. 

Undead and creatures immune to being charmed aren't 
affected by this spell. 

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d8 for 
each slot level above 1st. 


SPARE THE DYING 
Necromancy cantrip 


Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Touch 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Instantaneous 


You touch a living creature that has 0 hit points. The 
creature becomes stable. This spell has no effect on un- 
dead or constructs. 


SPEAK WITH DEAD 
3rd-level necromancy 


Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 10 feet 


Components: V, S, M (burning incense) 
Duration: 10 minutes 


You grant the semblance of life and intelligence to a 
corpse of your choice within range, allowing it to answer 
the questions you pose. The corpse must still have a 
mouth and can’t be undead. The spell fails if the corpse 
was the target of this spell within the last 10 days. 

Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five 
questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, in- 
cluding the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, 
cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no compul- 
sion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it 
recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn’t return the 
creature’s soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, 
the corpse can’t learn new information, doesn’t compre- 
hend anything that has happened since it died, and can’t 
speculate about future events. 


SPIDER CLIMB 
2nd-level transmutation 


Casting Time: 1 action 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M (a drop of bitumen and a spider) 
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour 


Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch gains 
the ability to move up, down, and across vertical surfaces 
and upside down along ceilings, while leaving its hands 
free. The target also gains a climbing speed equal to its 
walking speed. 


SPIRIT GUARDIANS 
3rd-level conjuration 


Casting Time: 1 action 

Range: Self (15-foot radius) 

Components: V, S, M (a holy symbol) 
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes 


You call forth spirits to protect you. They flit around you 
to a distance of 15 feet for the duration. If you are good or 
neutral, their spectral form appears angelic or fey (your 
choice). If you are evil, they appear fiendish. 

When you cast this spell, you can designate any num- 
ber of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. An 
affected creature’s speed is halved in the area, and when 
the creature enters the area for the first time on a turn 
or starts its turn there, it must make a Wisdom saving 
throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 radiant 
damage (if you are good or neutral) or 3d8 necrotic dam- 
age (if you are evil). On a successful save, the creature 
takes half as much damage. 

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 
1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. 


SPIRITUAL WEAPON 
2nd-level evocation 


Casting Time: 1 bonus action 
Range: 60 feet 


CHAPTER 11: SPELLS

»py this document for personal use only 








Components: V, S 
Duration: 1 minute 


You create a floating, spectral weapon within range that 
lasts for the duration or until you cast this spell again. 
When you cast the spell, you can make a melee spell 
attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon. On 
a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d8 + your 
spellcasting ability modifier. 

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the 
weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a crea- 
ture within 5 feet of it. 

The weapon can take whatever form you choose. 
Clerics of deities who are associated with a particular 
weapon (as St. Cuthbert is known for his mace and 
Thor for his hammer) make this spell’s effect resemble 
that weapon. 

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 
1d8 for every two slot levels above the 2nd. 


STONESKIN 
4th-level abjuration 


Casting Time: 1 action 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M (diamond dust worth 100 gp, which 
the spell consumes) 

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour 


This spell turns the flesh of a willing creature you touch 
as hard as stone. Until the spell ends, the target has 
resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and 
slashing damage. 


SUGGESTION 
2nd-level enchantment 


Casting Time: 1 action 

Range: 30 feet 

Components: V, M (a snake’s tongue and either a bit of 
honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil) 

Duration: Concentration, up to 8 hours 


You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence 
or two) and magically influence a creature you can see 
within range that can hear and understand you. Crea- 
tures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect. 
The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to 
make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the 
creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immo- 
late itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends 
the spell. 

The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a 
failed save, it pursues the course of action you described 
to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action 
can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested ac- 
tivity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends 
when the subject finishes what it was asked to do. 

You can also specify conditions that will trigger a spe- 
cial activity during the duration. For example, you might 
suggest that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar 
she meets. If the condition isn’t met before the spell ex- 
pires, the activity isn’t performed. 

If you or any of your companions damage the target, the 
spell ends. 


SUNBURST 
Sth-level evocation 


Casting Time: 1 action 

Range: 150 feet 

Components: V, S, M (fire and a piece of sunstone) 
Duration: Instantaneous 


Brilliant sunlight flashes in a 60-foot radius centered ona 
point you choose within range. Each creature in that light 
must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, 
a creature takes 12d6 radiant damage and is blinded 

for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much 
damage and isn’t blinded by this spell. Undead and oozes 
have disadvantage on this saving throw. 

A creature blinded by this spell makes another Consti- 
tution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a 
successful save, it is no longer blinded. 

This spell dispels any darkness in its area that was cre- 
ated by a spell. 


‘TELEPORT 
7th-level conjuration 


Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 10 feet 
Components: V 
Duration: Instantaneous 


This spell instantly transports you and up to eight willing 
creatures of your choice that you can see within range, 
or a single object that you can see within range, to a des- 
tination you select. If you target an object, it must be able 
to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can’t be held or 
carried by an unwilling creature. 

The destination you choose must be known to you, and 
it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your 
familiarity with the destination determines whether you 
arrive there successfully. The DM rolls d100 and consults 
the table. 

Familiarity. “Permanent circle” means a permanent 
teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know. “As- 
sociated object” means that you possess an object taken 
from the desired destination within the last six months, 
such as a book from a wizard’s library, bed linen from a 
royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich’s secret tomb. 

“Very familiar” is a place you have been very often, a 
place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see 
when you cast the spell. “Seen casually” is someplace 
you have seen more than once but with which you aren't 
very familiar. “Viewed once” is a place you have seen 
once, possibly using magic. “Description” is a place 
whose location and appearance you know through some- 
one else’s description, perhaps from a map. 

“False destination” is a place that doesn’t exist. Per- 
haps you tried to scry an enemy’s sanctum but instead 
viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport toa 
familiar location that no longer exists. 

On Target. You and your group (or the target object) 
appear where you want to. 

Off Target. You and your group (or the target object) 
appear a random distance away from the destination in 
a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 x 1d10 
percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For ex- 
ample, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, 
and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be

ment for personal use on 








off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines 
the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and des- 
ignating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on 
around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting 
to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you 
could be in trouble. 

Similar Area. You and your group (or the target object) 
wind up in a different area that’s visually or thematically 
similar to the target area. If you are heading for your 
home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in an- 
other wizard’s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop 
that has many of the same tools and implements as your 
laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar 
place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could 
conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane. 

Mishap. The spell’s unpredictable magic results ina 
difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target 
object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on 
the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can 
occur, dealing damage each time).

‘THAUMATURGY 


Transmutation cantrip 


Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 30 feet 
Components: V 
Duration: Up to 1 minute 


You manifest a minor wonder, a sign of supernatural 
power, within range. You create one of the following 
magical effects within range: 


- Your voice booms up to three times as loud as normal 
for 1 minute. 

« You cause flames to flicker, brighten, dim, or change 
color for 1 minute. 

- You cause harmless tremors in the ground 
for 1 minute. 

- You create an instantaneous sound that originates from 
a point of your choice within range, such as a rumble of 
thunder, the cry of a raven, or ominous whispers. 

- You instantaneously cause an unlocked door or window 
to fly open or slam shut. 

« You alter the appearance of your eyes for 1 minute. 


If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to 
three of its 1-minute effects active at a time, and you can 
dismiss such an effect as an action. 


THUNDERWAVE 
Ist-level evocation 


Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Self (15-foot cube) 
Components: V, S 
Duration: Instantaneous 


A wave of thunderous force sweeps out from you. Each 
creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must 
make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a 
creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet 
away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes 
half as much damage and isn’t pushed. 

In addition, unsecured objects that are completely 
within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet 
away from you by the spell’s effect, and the spell emits a 
thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet. 

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 
1d8 for each slot level above 1st. 


TIME STOP 
9th-level transmutation 


Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Self 
Components: V 
Duration: Instantaneous 


You briefly stop the flow of time for everyone but yourself. 
No time passes for other creatures, while you take 1d4 + 
1 turns in a row, during which you can use actions and 
move as normal. 

This spell ends if one of the actions you use during this 
period, or any effects that you create during this period, 
affects a creature other than you or an object being worn 
or carried by someone other than you. In addition, the 
spell ends if you move to a place more than 1,000 feet 
from the location where you cast it. 


‘TRUE RESURRECTION 
9th-level necromancy 


Casting Time: 1 hour 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M (a sprinkle of holy water and 
diamonds worth at least 25,000 gp, which the 
spell consumes) 

Duration: Instantaneous 


You touch a creature that has been dead for no longer 
than 200 years and that died for any reason except old 
age. If the creature’s soul is free and willing, the creature 
is restored to life with all its hit points. 

This spell closes all wounds, neutralizes any poison, 
cures all diseases, and lifts any curses affecting the crea- 
ture when it died. The spell replaces damaged or missing 
organs and limbs. If the creature was undead, it is re- 
stored to its non-undead form. 

The spell can even provide a new body if the original 
no longer exists, in which case you must speak the crea- 
ture’s name. The creature then appears in an unoccupied 
space you choose within 10 feet of you. 


CHAPTER 11: SPELLS 











TRUE SEEING 
6th-level divination 


Casting Time: 1 action 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M (an ointment for the eyes that costs 
25 gp; is made from mushroom powder, saffron, and 
fat; and is consumed by the spell) 

Duration: | hour 


This spell gives the willing creature you touch the ability 
to see things as they actually are. For the duration, the 
creature has truesight, notices secret doors hidden by 
magic, and can see into the Ethereal Plane, all out toa 
range of 120 feet. 


WALL OF FIRE 
4th-level evocation 


Casting Time: 1 action 

Range: 120 feet 

Components: V, S, M (a small piece of phosphorus) 
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute 


You create a wall of fire on a solid surface within range. 
You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, 
and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diame- 
ter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is opaque and 
lasts for the duration. 

When the wall appears, each creature within its area 
must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a 
creature takes 5d8 fire damage, or half as much damage 
on a successful save. 

One side of the wall, selected by you when you cast this 
spell, deals 5d8 fire damage to each creature that ends its 
turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall. A crea- 
ture takes the same damage when it enters the wall for 
the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other 
side of the wall deals no damage. 

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 
spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 
1d8 for each slot level above 4th. 


WALL OF STONE 
5th-level evocation 


Casting Time: 1 action 

Range: 120 feet 

Components: V, S, M (a small block of granite) 
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes 


A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence 

at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches 
thick and is composed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. 
Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other 
panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot pan- 
els that are only 3 inches thick. 

If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it ap- 
pears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your 
choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by 
the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that crea- 
ture can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it 
can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no 
longer enclosed by the wall. 

The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can’t 
occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall 
doesn’t need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. 


It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported 
by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a 
chasm or create a ramp. 

If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you 
must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You 
can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battle- 
ments, and so on. 

The wall is an object made of stone that can be dam- 
aged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 
hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit 
points destroys it and might cause connected panels to 
collapse at the DM’s discretion. 

If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its 
whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can’t 
be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the 
spell ends. 


WARDING BOND 
2nd-level abjuration 


Casting Time: 1 action 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S, M (a pair of platinum rings worth at 
least 50 gp each, which you and the target must wear 
for the duration) 

Duration: 1 hour 


This spell wards a willing creature you touch and creates 
a mystic connection between you and the target until the 
spell ends. While the target is within 60 feet of you, it 
gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and it has re- 
sistance to all damage. Also, each time it takes damage, 
you take the same amount of damage. 

The spell ends if you drop to 0 hit points or if you and 
the target become separated by more than 60 feet. It also 
ends if the spell is cast again on either of the connected 
creatures. You can also dismiss the spell as an action. 


‘WEB 


2nd-level conjuration 


Casting Time: 1 action 

Range: 60 feet 

Components: V, S, M (a bit of spiderweb) 
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour 


You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of 
your choice within range. The webs fill a 20-foot cube 
from that point for the duration. The webs are difficult 
terrain and lightly obscure their area. 

If the webs aren't anchored between two solid masses 
(such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or 
ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell 
ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a 
flat surface have a depth of 5 feet. 

Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that 
enters them during its turn must make a Dexterity saving 
throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long 
as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free. 

A creature restrained by the webs can use its action to 
make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it 
succeeds, it is no longer restrained. 

The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs 
exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire 
damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.

CHAPTER 12: MONSTERS 


AS THE DUNGEON MASTER, YOU HAVE A VAST ARRAY OF 
resources available to you to make the game exciting 
and fun for the players—and monsters are at the top of 
the list. A monster is defined as any creature that can be 
interacted with and potentially fought and killed. Even 
something as harmless as a frog or as benevolent as a 
unicorn is a monster by this definition. The term also 
applies to humans, elves, dwarves, and other folk who 
might be friends or rivals to the player characters. 

This chapter presents a wide selection of ready-to- 
play monsters—a sample of what can be found in the 
Monster Manual. Each description uses a standardized 
format that clearly explains the monster’s capabilities. 
Guidelines for understanding the information found in a 
monster’s statistics are given below. 


STATISTICS 


A monster’s statistics, sometimes referred to as its stat 
block, provide the essential information that you need to 
run the monster. 


SIZE 


A monster can be Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or 
Gargantuan. See chapter 9 of this document for more in- 
formation on creature size and space. 


TYPE 


A monster’s type speaks to its fundamental nature. Cer- 
tain spells, magic items, class features, and other effects 
in the game interact in special ways with creatures of a 
particular type. For example, an arrow of dragon slaying 
deals extra damage not only to dragons but also other 
creatures of the dragon type, such as dragon turtles 

and wyverns. 

The game includes the following monster types, which 
have no rules of their own. 

Aberrations are utterly alien beings. Many of them 
have innate magical abilities drawn from the creature’s 
alien mind rather than the mystical forces of the world. 
The quintessential aberrations are aboleths, beholders, 
mind flayers, and slaadi. 

Beasts are nonhumanoid creatures that are a natural 
part of the fantasy ecology. Some of them have magical 
powers, but most are unintelligent and lack any society 
or language. Beasts include all varieties of ordinary ani- 
mals, dinosaurs, and giant versions of animals. 

Celestials are creatures native to the Upper Planes. 
Many of them are the servants of deities, employed as 
messengers or agents in the mortal realm and through- 
out the planes. Celestials are good by nature, so the 
exceptional celestial who strays from a good alignment 
is a horrifying rarity. Celestials include angels, couatls, 
and pegasi. 

Constructs are made, not born. Some are programmed 
by their creators to follow a simple set of instructions, 
while others are imbued with sentience and capable of 
independent thought. Golems are the iconic constructs. 
Many creatures native to the outer plane of Mechanus, 


such as modrons, are constructs shaped from the 
raw material of the plane by the will of more powerful 
creatures. 

Dragons are large reptilian creatures of ancient origin 
and tremendous power. True dragons, including the good 
metallic dragons and the evil chromatic dragons, are 
highly intelligent and have innate magic. Also in this cat- 
egory are creatures distantly related to true dragons, but 
less powerful, less intelligent, and less magical, such as 
wyverns and pseudodragons. 

Elementals are creatures native to the elemental 
planes. Some creatures of this type are little more than 
animate masses of their respective elements, including 
the creatures simply called elementals. Others have 
biological forms infused with elemental energy. The 
races of genies, including djinn and efreet, form the most 
important civilizations on the elemental planes. Other 
elemental creatures include azers, invisible stalkers, and 
water weirds. 

Fey are magical creatures closely tied to the forces of 
nature. They dwell in twilight groves and misty forests. 
In some worlds, they are closely tied to the Feywild, also 
called the Plane of Faerie. Some are also found in the 
Outer Planes, particularly the planes of Arborea and the 
Beastlands. Fey include dryads, pixies, and satyrs. 

Fiends are creatures of wickedness that are native 
to the Lower Planes. A few are the servants of deities, 
but many more labor under the leadership of archdevils 
and demon princes. Evil priests and mages sometimes 
summon fiends to the material world to do their bidding. 
If an evil celestial is a rarity, a good fiend is almost in- 
conceivable. Fiends include demons, devils, hell hounds, 
rakshasas, and yugoloths. 

Giants tower over humans and their kind. They are 
humanlike in shape, though some have multiple heads 
(ettins) or deformities (fomorians). The six varieties of 
true giant are hill giants, stone giants, frost giants, fire 
giants, cloud giants, and storm giants. Besides these, 
creatures such as ogres and trolls are giants. 

Humanoids are the main peoples of the D&amp;D world, 
both civilized and savage, including humans and a tre- 
mendous variety of other species. They have language 
and culture, few if any innate magical abilities (though 
most humanoids can learn spellcasting), and a bipedal 
form. The most common humanoid races are the ones 
most suitable as player characters: humans, dwarves, 
elves, and halflings. Almost as numerous but far more 
savage and brutal, and almost uniformly evil, are the 
races of goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears), 
orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds. 

Monstrosities are monsters in the strictest sense— 
frightening creatures that are not ordinary, not truly 
natural, and almost never benign. Some are the results of 
magical experimentation gone awry (such as owlbears), 
and others are the product of terrible curses (including 
minotaurs and yuan-ti). They defy categorization, and in 
some sense serve as a catch-all category for creatures 
that don’t fit into any other type.

Oozes are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a fixed 
shape. They are mostly subterranean, dwelling in caves 
and dungeons and feeding on refuse, carrion, or crea- 
tures unlucky enough to get in their way. Black puddings 
and gelatinous cubes are among the most recogniz- 
able oozes. 

Plants in this context are vegetable creatures, not or- 
dinary flora. Most of them are ambulatory, and some are 
carnivorous. The quintessential plants are the shambling 
mound and the treant. Fungal creatures such as the gas 
spore and the myconid also fall into this category. 

Undead are once-living creatures brought to a horrify- 
ing state of undeath through the practice of necromantic 
magic or some unholy curse. Undead include walking 
corpses, such as vampires and zombies, as well as bodi- 
less spirits, such as ghosts and specters. 


TAGS 

A monster might have one or more tags appended to its 
type, in parentheses. For example, an orc has the human- 
oid (orc) type. The parenthetical tags provide additional 
categorization for certain creatures. The tags have no 
rules of their own, but something in the game, such as 

a magic item, might refer to them. For instance, a spear 
that is especially effective at fighting demons would work 
against any monster that has the demon tag. 


ALIGNMENT 


A monster’s alignment provides a clue to its disposition 
and how it behaves in a roleplaying or combat situation. 
For example, a chaotic evil monster might be difficult 

to reason with and might attack characters on sight, 
whereas a neutral monster might be willing to negotiate. 
See chapter 4 of this document for descriptions of the 
different alignments. 

The alignment specified in a monster’s stat block is 
the default. Feel free to depart from it and change a mon- 
ster’s alignment to suit the needs of your campaign. If you 
want a good-aligned green dragon or an evil storm giant, 
there’s nothing stopping you. 

Some creatures can have any alignment. In other 
words, you choose the monster’s alignment. Some mon- 
ster’s alignment entry indicates a tendency or aversion 
toward law, chaos, good, or evil. For example, a berserker 
can be any chaotic alignment (chaotic good, chaotic neu- 
tral, or chaotic evil), as befits its wild nature. 

Many creatures of low intelligence have no compre- 
hension of law or chaos, good or evil. They don’t make 
moral or ethical choices, but rather act on instinct. These 
creatures are unaligned, which means they don’t have an 
alignment. 


ARMOR CLASS 


A monster that wears armor or carries a shield has an Ar- 
mor Class (AC) that takes its armor, shield, and Dexterity 
into account. Otherwise, a monster’s AC is based on its 
Dexterity modifier and natural armor, if any. If a monster 
has natural armor, wears armor, or carries a shield, this 
is noted in parentheses after its AC value. 


HIT PoINtTs 


A monster usually dies or is destroyed when it drops 
to 0 hit points. For more on hit points, see chapter 1 of 
this document. 

A monster’s hit points are presented both as a die 
expression and as an average number. For example, a 
monster with 2d8 hit points has 9 hit points on aver- 
age (2 x 414). 

A monster’s size determines the die used to calculate 
its hit points, as shown in the Hit Dice by Size table. 


Hit Dice By SIZE 


Monster Size Hit Die Average HP per Die 
Tiny d4 2Va 
Small d6 3V2 
Medium d8 4Va 
Large d10 5V2 
Huge d12 6" 
Gargantuan d20 10Y2 


A monster’s Constitution modifier also affects the 
number of hit points it has. Its Constitution modifier is 
multiplied by the number of Hit Dice it possesses, and 
the result is added to its hit points. For example, if a mon- 
ster has a Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier) and 2d8 Hit 
Dice, it has 2d8 + 2 hit points (average 11). 


SPEED 


A monster’s speed tells you how far it can move on its 
turn. For more information on speed, see chapter 8 and 
chapter 9 of this document. 

All creatures have a walking speed, simply called the 
monster’s speed. Creatures that have no form of ground- 
based locomotion have a walking speed of 0 feet. 

Some creatures have one or more of the following addi- 
tional movement modes. 


BURROW 

A monster that has a burrowing speed can use that speed 
to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. A monster can’t 
burrow through solid rock unless it has a special trait 
that allows it to do so. 


CLIMB 

A monster that has a climbing speed can use all or part of 
its movement to move on vertical surfaces. The monster 
doesn’t need to spend extra movement to climb. 


Piy 

A monster that has a flying speed can use all or part of 
its movement to fly. Some monsters have the ability to 
hover, which makes them hard to knock out of the air (as 
explained in the rules on flying in chapter 9 of this docu- 
ment). Such a monster stops hovering when it dies. 


SWIM 
A monster that has a swimming speed doesn’t need to 
spend extra movement to swim.

ABILITY SCORES 


Every monster has six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, 


Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) and 
corresponding modifiers. For more information on abil- 
ity scores and how they’re used in play, see chapter 7 of 
this document. 


SAVING THROWS 


The Saving Throws entry is reserved for creatures that 


are adept at resisting certain kinds of effects. For exam- 
ple, a creature that isn’t easily charmed or frightened 
might gain a bonus on its Wisdom saving throws. Most 
creatures don’t have special saving throw bonuses, in 
which case this section is absent. 

A saving throw bonus is the sum of a monster’s relevant 
ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is deter- 
mined by the monster’s challenge rating (as shown in the 
Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating table).

SKILLS 


The Skills entry is reserved for monsters that are profi- 
cient in one or more skills. For example, a monster that is 
very perceptive and stealthy might have bonuses to Wis- 
dom (Perception) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks. 

A skill bonus is the sum of a monster’s relevant ability 
modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined 
by the monster’s challenge rating (as shown in the Profi- 
ciency Bonus by Challenge Rating table). Other modifiers 
might apply. For instance, a monster might have a larg- 
er-than-expected bonus (usually double its proficiency 
bonus) to account for its heightened expertise. 


VULNERABILITIES, RESISTANCES, 
AND IMMUNITIES 


Some creatures have vulnerability, resistance, or immu- 


nity to certain types of damage. Particular creatures are 
even resistant or immune to damage from nonmagical at- 
tacks (a magical attack is an attack delivered by a spell, a 


magic item, or another magical source). In addition, some 
creatures are immune to certain conditions. 


SENSES 


The Senses entry notes a monster’s passive Wisdom 
(Perception) score, as well as any special senses the mon- 
ster might have. Special senses are described below. 


BLINDSIGHT 
A monster with blindsight can perceive its surroundings 
without relying on sight, within a specific radius. 
Creatures without eyes, such as grimlocks and gray 
oozes, typically have this special sense, as do creatures 
with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and 
true dragons. 
If a monster is naturally blind, it has a parenthetical 
note to this effect, indicating that the radius of its blind- 
sight defines the maximum range of its perception. 


DARKVISION 

A monster with darkvision can see in the dark within a 
specific radius. The monster can see in dim light within 
the radius as if it were bright light, and in darkness as 
if it were dim light. The monster can’t discern color in 
darkness, only shades of gray. Many creatures that live 
underground have this special sense. 


‘TREMORSENSE 

A monster with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the 
origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided 

that the monster and the source of the vibrations are in 
contact with the same ground or substance. Tremorsense 
can't be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures. 
Many burrowing creatures, such as ankhegs and umber 
hulks, have this special sense. 


‘TRUESIGHT 

A monster with truesight can, out to a specific range, see 
in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures 
and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and 
succeed on saving throws against them, and perceive 

the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is 
transformed by magic. Furthermore, the monster can see 
into the Ethereal Plane within the same range. 


LANGUAGES 


The languages that a monster can speak are listed in al- 
phabetical order. Sometimes a monster can understand a 
language but can’t speak it, and this is noted in its entry. 
A “—” indicates that a creature neither speaks nor under- 
stands any language. 


‘TELEPATHY 
Telepathy is a magical ability that allows a monster to 
communicate mentally with another creature within a 
specified range. The contacted creature doesn’t need to 
share a language with the monster to communicate in 
this way with it, but it must be able to understand at least 
one language. A creature without telepathy can receive 
and respond to telepathic messages but can’t initiate or 
terminate a telepathic conversation. 

A telepathic monster doesn’t need to see a contacted 
creature and can end the telepathic contact at any time.

The contact is broken as soon as the two creatures are 
no longer within range of each other or if the telepathic 
monster contacts a different creature within range. A 
telepathic monster can initiate or terminate a telepathic 
conversation without using an action, but while the mon- 
ster is incapacitated, it can’t initiate telepathic contact, 
and any current contact is terminated. 

A creature within the area of an antimagic field or in 
any other location where magic doesn’t function can’t 
send or receive telepathic messages. 


CHALLENGE 


A monster’s challenge rating tells you how great a threat 
the monster is, according to the encounter-building 
guidelines in chapter 13 of this document. Those guide- 
lines specify the number of adventurers of a certain level 
that should be able to defeat a monster of a particular 
challenge rating without suffering any deaths. 

Monsters that are significantly weaker than 1st-level 
characters have a challenge rating lower than 1. Mon- 
sters with a challenge rating of 0 are insignificant except 
in large numbers; those with no effective attacks are 
worth no experience points, while those that have attacks 
are worth 10 XP each. 

Some monsters present a greater challenge than even a 
typical 20th-level party can handle. These monsters have 
a challenge rating of 21 or higher and are specifically de- 
signed to test player skill. 


EXPERIENCE POINTS 

The number of experience points (XP) a monster is worth 
is based on its challenge rating. Typically, XP is awarded 
for defeating the monster, although the DM may also 
award XP for neutralizing the threat posed by the mon- 
ster in some other manner. 

Unless something tells you otherwise, a monster sum- 
moned by a spell or other magical ability is worth the XP 
noted in its stat block. 

The guidelines in chapter 13 of this document explain 
how to create encounters using XP budgets, as well as 
how to adjust an encounter’s difficulty. 


EXPERIENCE POINTS BY CHALLENGE RATING 


Challenge XP Challenge XP 
0 0 or 10 14 11,500

SPECIAL TRAITS 

Special traits (which appear after a monster’s challenge 
rating but before any actions or reactions) are character- 
istics that are likely to be relevant in a combat encounter 
and that require some explanation. 


INNATE SPELLCASTING 

A monster with the innate ability to cast spells has the 
Innate Spellcasting special trait. Unless noted otherwise, 
an innate spell of 1st level or higher is always cast at its 
lowest possible level and can’t be cast at a higher level. 

If a monster has a cantrip where its level matters and no 
level is given, use the monster’s challenge rating. 

An innate spell can have special rules or restrictions. 
For example, a drow mage can innately cast the /evitate 
spell, but the spell has a “self only” restriction, which 
means that the spell affects only the drow mage. 

A monster’s innate spells can’t be swapped out with 
other spells. If a monster’s innate spells don’t require at- 
tack rolls, no attack bonus is given for them. 


SPELLCASTING 

A monster with the Spellcasting class feature has a spell- 
caster level and spell slots, which it uses to cast its spells 
of 1st level and higher (as explained in chapter 10 of this 
document). The spellcaster level is also used for any can- 
trips included in the feature. 

The monster has a list of spells known or prepared 
from a particular class. The list might also include spells 
from a feature in that class, such as the Divine Domain 
feature of the cleric. The monster is considered a mem- 
ber of that class when attuning to or using a magic item 
that requires membership in the class or access to its 
spell list. 

A monster can cast a spell from its list at a higher level 
if it has the spell slot to do so. For example, a drow mage 
with the 3rd-level lightning bolt spell can cast it as a 5th- 
level spell by using one of its 5th-level spell slots. 

You can change the spells that a monster knows or has 
prepared, replacing any spell on a monster’s spell list 
with a different spell of the same level and from the same 
class list. If you do so, you might cause the monster to 
be a greater or lesser threat than suggested by its chal- 
lenge rating. 


ACTIONS 


When a monster takes its action, it can choose from 
the options in the Actions section of its stat block or 
use one of the actions available to all creatures, such 

as the Dash or Hide action, as described in chapter 9 of 
this document. 


MELEE AND RANGED ATTACKS 

The most common actions that a monster will take in 
combat are melee and ranged attacks. These can be spell 
attacks or weapon attacks, where the “weapon” might be 
a manufactured item or a natural weapon, such as a claw 
or tail spike. For more information on different kinds of 
attacks, see chapter 9 of this document. 

Creature vs. Target. The target of a melee or ranged 
attack is usually either one creature or one target, the 
difference being that a “target” can be a creature or 
an object. 


CHAPTER 12: MONSTERS 





D&amp;D Basic Rules (Version 1.0). Not for resale. Permission grantec 


to print and photocopy this document for personal use only 








Hit. Any damage dealt or other effects that occur as 
a result of an attack hitting a target are described after 
the “Hit” notation. You have the option of taking average 
damage or rolling the damage; for this reason, both the 
average damage and the die expression are presented. 
Miss. If an attack has an effect that occurs on a miss, 
that information is presented after the “Miss:” notation. 


MULTIATTACK 

Acreature that can make multiple attacks on its turn has 
the Multiattack ability. A creature can’t use Multiattack 
when making an opportunity attack, which must be a sin- 
gle melee attack. 


AMMUNITION 

A monster carries enough ammunition to make its 
ranged attacks. You can assume that a monster has 2d4 
pieces of ammunition for a thrown weapon attack, and 
2d10 pieces of ammunition for a projectile weapon such 
as a bow or crossbow. 


REACTIONS 


If a monster can do something special with its reaction, 
that information is contained here. If a creature has no 
special reaction, this section is absent. 


LIMITED USAGE 


Some special abilities have restrictions on the number of 
times they can be used. 

X/Day. The notation “X/Day” means a special ability 
can be used X number of times and that a monster must 
finish a long rest to regain expended uses. For example, 
“1/Day” means a special ability can be used once and that 
the monster must finish a long rest to use it again. 

Recharge X—Y. The notation “Recharge X-Y” means a 
monster can use a special ability once and that the ability 
then has a random chance of recharging during each 
subsequent round of combat. At the start of each of the 
monster’s turns, roll a d6. If the roll is one of the numbers 
in the recharge notation, the monster regains the use of 
the special ability. The ability also recharges when the 
monster finishes a short or long rest. 

For example, “Recharge 5—6” means a monster can 
use the special ability once. Then, at the start of the mon- 
ster’s turn, it regains the use of that ability if it rolls a 5 or 
6 ona d6. 

Recharge after a Short or Long Rest. This notation 
means that a monster can use a special ability once and 
then must finish a short or long rest to use it again. 


—————————————eoOooOoOOoOoOoeoeoeoeoeeeeee—— 
GRAPPLE RULES FOR MONSTERS 


Many monsters have special attacks that allow them to 
quickly grapple prey. When a monster hits with such an 
attack, it doesn’t need to make an additional ability check to 
determine whether the grapple succeeds, unless the attack 
says otherwise. 

A creature grappled by the monster can use its action 
to try to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength 
(Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against the 
escape DC in the monster’s stat block. If no escape DC 
is given, assume the DC is 10 + the monster’s Strength 
(Athletics) modifier. 


EQUIPMENT 


A stat block rarely refers to equipment, other than armor 
or weapons used by a monster. A creature that customar- 
ily wears clothes, such as a humanoid, is assumed to be 
dressed appropriately. 

You can equip monsters with additional gear and trin- 
kets however you like, using chapter 5 of this document 
for inspiration, and you decide how much of a monster’s 
equipment is recoverable after the creature is slain and 
whether any of that equipment is still usable. A battered 
suit of armor made for a monster is rarely usable by 
someone else, for instance. 

If a spellcasting monster needs material components 
to cast its spells, assume that it has the material compo- 
nents it needs to cast the spells in its stat block. 


LEGENDARY CREATURES 


A legendary creature can do things that ordinary crea- 
tures can't. It can take special actions outside its turn, 
and it might exert magical influence for miles around. 

If a creature assumes the form of a legendary creature, 
such as through a spell, it doesn’t gain that form’s legend- 
ary actions, lair actions, or regional effects. 


LEGENDARY ACTIONS 


A legendary creature can take a certain number of 
special actions—called legendary actions—outside its 
turn. Only one legendary action option can be used at 

a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. A 
creature regains its spent legendary actions at the start 
of its turn. It can forgo using them, and it can’t use them 
while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. 
If surprised, it can’t use them until after its first turn in 
the combat. 


A LEGENDARY CREATURE’S LAIR 


A legendary creature might have a section describing 

its lair and the special effects it can create while there, 
either by act of will or simply by being present. Not all 
legendary creatures have lairs. This section applies only 
to legendary creatures that spend a great deal of time in 
their lairs and are most likely to be encountered there. 


LAIR ACTIONS 

If a legendary creature has lair actions, it can use them 
to harness the ambient magic in its lair. On initiative 
count 20 (losing all initiative ties), it can use one of its lair 
action options. It can’t do so while incapacitated or other- 
wise unable to take actions. If surprised, it can’t use one 
until after its first turn in the combat. 


REGIONAL EFFECTS 

The mere presence of a legendary creature can have 
strange and wondrous effects on its environment, as 
noted in this section. Regional effects end abruptly or dis- 
sipate over time when the legendary creature dies.

Legendary Resistance (3/Day). If the dragon fails a saving 
throw, it can choose to succeed instead. 


ACTIONS 





Multiattack. The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. 
It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two 
with its claws. 


Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.

Tail Attack. The dragon makes a tail attack. 

Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions). The dragon beats its wings. 
Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed 
ona DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (2d6 + 8)

The odor of sulfur and pumice surrounds a red dragon, 
whose swept-back horns and spinal frill define its silhou- 
ette. Its beaked snout vents smoke at all times, and its 
eyes dance with flame when it is angry. 


A RED DRAGON’S LAIR 


Red dragons lair in high mountains or hills, dwelling in 
caverns under snow-capped peaks, or within the deep 
halls of abandoned mines and dwarven strongholds. 
Caves with volcanic or geothermal activity are the most 
highly prized red dragon lairs, creating hazards that hin- 
der intruders and letting searing heat and volcanic gases 
wash over a dragon as it sleeps. 

With its hoard well protected deep within the lair, a red 
dragon spends as much of its time outside the mountain 
as in it. For a red dragon, the great heights of the world 
are the throne from which it can look out to survey all it 
controls—and the wider world it seeks to control. 

Throughout the lair complex, servants erect monu- 
ments to the dragon’s power, telling the grim story of 
its life, the enemies it has slain, and the nations it has 
conquered. 


LAIR ACTIONS 

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon 
takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; 
the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row: 


- Magma erupts from a point on the ground the dragon 
can see within 120 feet of it, creating a 20-foot-high, 
5-foot-radius geyser. Each creature in the geyser’s area 
must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 
21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much 
damage on a successful one. 

- A tremor shakes the lair in a 60-foot radius around the 

dragon. Each creature other than the dragon on the 

ground in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity 
saving throw or be knocked prone. 

Volcanic gases form a cloud in a 20-foot-radius sphere 

centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet 

of it. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area 
is lightly obscured. It lasts until initiative count 20 on 
the next round. Each creature that starts its turn in the 
cloud must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving 
throw or be poisoned until the end of its turn. While 
poisoned in this way, a creature is incapacitated. 


REGIONAL EFFECTS 

The region containing a legendary red dragon’s lair is 
warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more 
of the following effects: 


« Small earthquakes are common within 6 miles of the 
dragon’s lair. 

« Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernatu- 
rally warm and tainted by sulfur. 

- Rocky fissures within 1 mile of the dragon’s lair form 
portals to the Elemental Plane of Fire, allowing crea- 
tures of elemental fire into the world to dwell nearby. 


If the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 
1d10 days.

Petrifying Gaze. |f a creature starts its turn within 30 feet 
of the basilisk and the two of them can see each other, the 
basilisk can force the creature to make a DC 12 Constitution 
saving throw if the basilisk isn’t incapacitated. On a failed

restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its 
next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the 
creature is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell 
or other magic. 

A creature that isn’t surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the 
saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can’t see 
the basilisk until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its 
eyes again. If it looks at the basilisk in the meantime, it must 
immediately make the save. 

If the basilisk sees its reflection within 30 feet of it in

Ethereal Sight. The ghost can see 60 feet into the Ethereal 
Plane when it is on the Material Plane, and vice versa. 


Incorporeal Movement. The ghost can move through other 
creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 
(1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. 


ACTIONS 


Withering Touch. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., 


one target. Hit: 17 (4d6 + 3) necrotic damage. 


Etherealness. The ghost enters the Ethereal Plane from the 
Material Plane, or vice versa. It is visible on the Material Plane 
while it is in the Border Ethereal, and vice versa, yet it can’t 
affect or be affected by anything on the other plane. 


Horrifying Visage. Each non-undead creature within 60 feet 
of the ghost that can see it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom 
saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. If the save fails by 
5 or more, the target also ages 1d4 x 10 years. A frightened 
target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its 
turns, ending the frightened condition on itself on a success. 
If a target’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, 
the target is immune to this ghost’s Horrifying Visage for the 
next 24 hours. The aging effect can be reversed with a greater 
restoration spell, but only within 24 hours of it occurring. 


Possession (Recharge 6). One humanoid that the ghost can 
see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma 
saving throw or be possessed by the ghost; the ghost then 
disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control 
of its body. The ghost now controls the body but doesn’t 
deprive the target of awareness. The ghost can’t be targeted 
by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn 
undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, 
Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It 
otherwise uses the possessed target’s statistics, but doesn’t 
gain access to the target’s knowledge, class features, or 
proficiencies. 

The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, 
the ghost ends it as a bonus action, or the ghost is turned or 
forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When 
the possession ends, the ghost reappears in an unoccupied 
space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this 
ghost’s Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the 
saving throw or after the possession ends. 





A ghost is the soul of a once-living creature, bound to 
haunt a location, creature, or object from its life.

before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, 
and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the 
harpy, a target can repeat the saving throw. A charmed target 
can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its 
turns. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it. 

A target that successfully saves is immune to this harpy’s 
song for the next 24 hours.

Petrifying Gaze. When a creature that can see the medusa’s 
eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of the medusa, the medusa 
can force it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw if 
the medusa isn’t incapacitated and can see the creature. If 
the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly 
petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to 
turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must 
repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming 
petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The 
petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the greater 
restoration spell or other magic. 

Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the 
saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it 
can’t see the medusa until the start of its next turn, when it 
can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the medusa in 
the meantime, it must immediately make the save. 

If the medusa sees itself reflected on a polished surface 
within 30 feet of it and in an area of bright light, the medusa 
is, due to its curse, affected by its own gaze.

Eye Rays. The spectator shoots up to two of the following 
magical eye rays at one or two creatures it can see within 90 
feet of it. It can use each ray only once ona turn. 


1. Confusion Ray. The target must succeed on a DC 13 
Wisdom saving throw, or it can’t take reactions until the end 
of its next turn. On its turn, the target can’t move, and it 
uses its action to make a melee or ranged attack against a 
randomly determined creature within range. If the target can’t 
attack, it does nothing on its turn. 

2. Paralyzing Ray. The target must succeed on a DC 13 
Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The 
target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its 
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. 

3. Fear Ray. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom 
saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can 
repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with 
disadvantage if the spectator is visible to the target, ending 
the effect on itself on a success. 

4. Wounding Ray. The target must make a DC 13 
Constitution saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) necrotic damage 
ona failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 


Create Food and Water. The spectator magically creates 
enough food and water to sustain itself for 24 hours. 


REACTIONS 


Spell Reflection. \f the spectator makes a successful saving 
throw against a spell, or a spell attack misses it, the spectator 
can choose another creature (including the spellcaster) it can 
see within 30 feet of it. The spell targets the chosen creature 
instead of the spectator. If the spell forced a saving throw, 
the chosen creature makes its own save. If the spell was an 
attack, the attack roll is rerolled against the chosen creature. 





A spectator is a lesser type of beholder—a foul and deadly 
aberration. It resembles a floating sphere with a gaping 
maw and a single great eye, set within four eyestalks that 
shoot forth deadly rays.

attack. Instead, at the start of each of the stirge’s turns, the 
target loses 5 (1d4 + 3) hit points due to blood loss. 

The stirge can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its 
movement. It does so after it drains 10 hit points of blood 
from the target or the target dies. A creature, including the 
target, can use its action to detach the stirge. 











This horrid monster looks like a cross between a large 
bat and an oversized mosquito. Its legs end in sharp pin- 
cers, and its long, needle-like proboscis slashes the air as 
it seeks to feed on the blood of living creatures.

NONPLAYER CHARACTERS 


This section contains statistics for various humanoid 

nonplayer characters (NPCs) that adventurers might en- 
counter during a D&amp;D campaign. These stat blocks can 
be used to represent both human and nonhuman NPCs. 


CUSTOMIZING NPCs 


There are many easy ways to customize the NPCs in this 


appendix for your home campaign. 

Racial Traits. You can add racial traits to an NPC. 
For example, a halfling priest might have a speed of 25 
feet and the Lucky trait. Adding racial traits to an NPC 
doesn’t alter its challenge rating. For more on racial 
traits, see chapter 2 of this document. 

Spell Swaps. One way to customize an NPC spell- 
caster is to replace one or more of its spells. You can 
substitute any spell on the NPC’s spell list with a dif- 
ferent spell of the same level from the same spell list. 
Swapping spells in this manner doesn’t alter an NPC’s 
challenge rating. 

Armor and Weapon Swaps. You can upgrade or 
downgrade an NPC’s armor, or add or switch weapons. 
Adjustments to Armor Class and damage can change an 
NPC’s challenge rating. 

Magic Items. The more powerful an NPC, the more 


likely it has one or more magic items in its possession. A 


mage, for example, might have a magic staff or wand, as 
well as one or more potions and scrolls. Giving an NPC 
a potent damage-dealing magic item could alter its chal- 
lenge rating. 

A few magic items are described in chapter 14 of 
this document.

CHAPTER 13: BUILDING COMBAT ENCOUNTERS 


WHEN CREATING A COMBAT ENCOUNTER, LET YOUR imag- 
ination run wild and build something your players will 
enjoy. Once you have the details figured out, use this sec- 
tion to adjust the difficulty of the encounter. 


COMBAT ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY 


There are four categories of encounter difficulty. 

Easy. An easy encounter doesn’t tax the characters’ 
resources or put them in serious peril. They might lose a 
few hit points, but victory is pretty much guaranteed. 

Medium. A medium encounter usually has one or two 
scary moments for the players, but the characters should 
emerge victorious with no casualties. One or more of 
them might need to use healing resources. 

Hard. A hard encounter could go badly for the adven- 
turers. Weaker characters might get taken out of the 
fight, and there’s a slim chance that one or more charac- 
ters might die. 

Deadly. A deadly encounter could be lethal for one or 
more player characters. Survival often requires good tac- 
tics and quick thinking, and the party risks defeat.

EVALUATING ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY 
Use the following method to gauge the difficulty of any 
combat encounter. 

1. Determine XP Thresholds. First, determine the ex- 
perience point (XP) thresholds for each character in the 
party. The XP Thresholds by Character Level table has 
four XP thresholds for each character level, one for each 
category of encounter difficulty. Use a character’s level to 
determine his or her XP thresholds. Repeat this process 
for every character in the party. 





2. Determine the Party’s XP Threshold. For each 
category of encounter difficulty, add up the characters’ 
XP thresholds. This determines the party’s XP threshold. 
You'll end up with four totals, one for each category of en- 
counter difficulty. 

For example, if your party includes three 3rd-level 
characters and one 2nd-level character, the party’s 
totaled XP thresholds would be as follows: 


Easy: 275 XP (75 + 75+ 75 + 50) 

Medium: 550 XP (150 + 150 + 150 + 100) 
Hard: 825 XP (225 + 225 + 225 + 150) 
Deadly: 1,400 XP (400 + 400 + 400 + 200) 


Record the totals, because you can use them for every 
encounter in your adventure. 

3. Total the Monsters’ XP. Add up the XP for all of 
the monsters in the encounter. Every monster has an XP 
value in its stat block. 

4, Modify Total XP for Multiple Monsters. If the 
encounter includes more than one monster, apply a 
multiplier to the monsters’ total XP. The more monsters 
there are, the more attack rolls you're making against the 
characters in a given round, and the more dangerous the 
encounter becomes. To correctly gauge an encounter’s 
difficulty, multiply the total XP of all the monsters in 
the encounter by the value given in the Encounter Multi- 
pliers table. 

For example, if an encounter includes four monsters 
worth a total of 500 XP, you would multiply the total XP 
of the monsters by 2, for an adjusted value of 1,000 XP. 
This adjusted value is not what the monsters are worth in 
terms of XP; the adjusted value’s only purpose is to help 
you accurately assess the encounter’s difficulty. 

When making this calculation, don’t count any mon- 
sters whose challenge rating is significantly below the 
average challenge rating of the other monsters in the 
group unless you think the weak monsters significantly 
contribute to the difficulty of the encounter. 


ENCOUNTER MULTIPLIERS 


Number of Number of 
Monsters Multiplier Monsters Multiplier 
] xal 7-10 % 25 
2 x5 11-14 x3 
3-6 x2 1Sormore x4 


5. Compare XP. Compare the monsters’ adjusted XP 
value to the party’s XP thresholds. The threshold that 
equals the adjusted XP value determines the encounter’s 
difficulty. If there’s no match, use the closest threshold 
that is lower than the adjusted XP value. 

For example, an encounter with one bugbear and three 
hobgoblins has an adjusted XP value of 1,000, making it 
a hard encounter for a party of three 3rd-level characters 
and one 2nd-level character (which has a hard encounter 
threshold of 825 XP and a deadly encounter threshold of 
1,400 XP). 


CHAPTER 13: BUILDING COMBAT ENCOUNTERS

PARTY SIZE 


The preceding guidelines assume that you have a party 
consisting of three to five adventurers. 

If the party contains fewer than three characters, apply 
the next highest multiplier on the Encounter Multipliers 
table. For example, apply a multiplier of 1.5 when the 
characters fight a single monster, and a multiplier of 5 for 
groups of fifteen or more monsters. 

If the party contains six or more characters, use the 
next lowest multiplier on the table. Use a multiplier of 0.5 
for a single monster. 


MULTIPART ENCOUNTERS 


Sometimes an encounter features multiple enemies that 


the party doesn’t face all at once. For example, monsters 
might come at the party in waves. For such encounters, 
treat each discrete part or wave as a separate encounter 
for the purpose of determining its difficulty. 

A party can’t benefit from a short rest between parts of 
a multipart encounter, so they won't be able to spend Hit 
Dice to regain hit points or recover any abilities that re- 
quire a short rest to regain. As a rule, if the adjusted XP 
value for the monsters in a multipart encounter is higher 
than one-third of the party’s expected XP total for the 
adventuring day (see “The Adventuring Day,” below), the 


encounter is going to be tougher than the sum of its parts. 


BUILDING ENCOUNTERS ON A 
BUDGET 


You can build an encounter if you know its desired diffi- 


culty. The party’s XP thresholds give you an XP budget 
that you can spend on monsters to build easy, medium, 
hard, and deadly encounters. Just remember that groups 
of monsters eat up more of that budget than their base 
XP values would indicate (See step 4). 

For example, using the party from step 2, you can build 
a medium encounter by making sure that the adjusted 
XP value of the monsters is at least 550 XP (the party’s 
threshold for a medium encounter) and no more than 825 
XP (the party’s threshold for a hard encounter). A single 
monster of challenge rating 3 (such as a manticore or 
owlbear) is worth 700 XP, so that’s one possibility. If you 
want a pair of monsters, each one will count for 1.5 times 
its base XP value. A pair of dire wolves (worth 200 XP 
each) have an adjusted XP value of 600, making them a 
medium encounter for the party as well. 

To assist with this approach, appendix B in the Dun- 
geon Master’s Guide presents a list of all monsters in 
the Monster Manual organized by challenge rating. See 
“Monsters by Challenge Rating” later in this chapter for a 
list by CR of the monsters included in this document. 


THE ADVENTURING DAY 


Assuming typical adventuring conditions and average 
luck, most adventuring parties can handle about six to 
eight medium or hard encounters in a day. If the adven- 
ture has more easy encounters, the adventurers can get 
through more. If it has more deadly encounters, they can 
handle fewer. 

In the same way you figure out the difficulty of an en- 
counter, you can use the XP values of monsters and other 


opponents in an adventure as a guideline for how far the 
party is likely to progress. 

For each character in the party, use the Adventuring 
Day XP table to estimate how much XP that character is 
expected to earn in a day. Add together the values of all 
party members to get a total for the party’s adventuring 
day. This provides a rough estimate of the adjusted XP 
value for encounters the party can handle before the 
characters will need to take a long rest. 


ADVENTURING Day XP 


Adjusted XP per Day Adjusted XP per Day 
Level per Character Level per Character 
Ist 300 11th 10,500 
2nd 600 12th 11,500 
3rd 1,200 13th 13,500 
4th 1,700 14th 15,000 
5th 3,500 15th 18,000 
6th 4,000 16th 20,000 
7th 5,000 17th 25,000 
8th 6,000 18th 27,000 
9th 7,500 19th 30,000 
10th 9,000 20th 40,000 


SHORT RESTS 

In general, over the course of a full adventuring day, the 
party will likely need to take two short rests, about one- 
third and two-thirds of the way through the day. 


MODIFYING ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY 


An encounter can be made easier or harder based on the 
choice of location and the situation. 

Increase the difficulty of the encounter by one step 
(from easy to medium, for example) if the characters have 
a drawback that their enemies don’t. Reduce the difficulty 
by one step if the characters have a benefit that their en- 
emies don’t. Any additional benefit or drawback pushes 
the encounter one step in the appropriate direction. If the 
characters have both a benefit and a drawback, the two 
cancel each other out. 

Situational drawbacks include the following: 


« The whole party is surprised, and the enemy isn’t. 

« The enemy has cover, and the party doesn't. 

« The characters are unable to see the enemy. 

- The characters are taking damage every round from 
some environmental effect or magical source. 

« The characters are hanging from a rope, in the midst of 
scaling a sheer wall or cliff, stuck to the floor, or other- 
wise in a situation that hinders their mobility. 


Situational benefits are similar to drawbacks except 
that they benefit the characters instead of the enemy. 


FUN COMBAT ENCOUNTERS 


The following features can add more fun and suspense to 


a combat encounter: 


« Terrain features that pose inherent risks to both the 
characters and their enemies, such as a frayed rope 
bridge and pools of green slime 

« Terrain features that provide a change of elevation, 
such as pits, stacks of empty crates, and ledges

a 


CHALLENGE RATING 


When putting together an encounter or adventure, 
especially at lower levels, exercise caution when using 
monsters whose challenge rating is higher than the party’s 
average level. Such a creature might deal enough damage 
with a single action to take out adventurers of a lower level. 
For example, an ogre has a challenge rating of 2, but it can 
killa 1st-level wizard with a single blow. 


eee 


- Features that either inspire or force characters and 
their enemies to move around, such as chandeliers, 
kegs of gunpowder or oil, and whirling blade traps 


« Enemies in hard-to-reach locations or defensive posi- 
tions, so that characters who normally attack at range 


are forced to move around the battlefield

CHAPTER 14: MAGIc ITEMS 


EVERY ADVENTURE HOLDS THE PROMISE—BUT NOT A 
guarantee—of finding one or more magic items. This 
chapter presents an assortment of magic items that hints 
at the wider variety of magic items waiting to be found in 
the worlds of D&amp;D. See the Dungeon Master’s Guide for 
many more items. 


UsING A MaAcic ITEM 


A magic item’s description explains how the item works. 
Handling a magic item is enough to give a character a 
sense that something is extraordinary about the item. 
The identify spell is the fastest way to reveal an item’s 
properties. Alternatively, a character can focus on one 
magic item during a short rest, while being in physical 
contact with the item. At the end of the rest, the character 
learns the item’s properties, as well as how to use them. 
Potions are an exception; a little taste is enough to tell the 
taster what the potion does. 

Some magic items require a creature to form a bond 
with them before their magical properties can be used. 
This bond is called attunement, and certain items have a 
prerequisite for it. If the prerequisite is a class, a creature 
must be a member of that class to attune to the item. If 
the prerequisite is to be a spellcaster, a creature qualifies 
if it can cast at least one spell using its traits or features, 
not using a magic item or the like. 

Attuning to an item requires a creature to spend a short 
rest focused on only that item while being in physical con- 
tact with it (this can’t be the same short rest used to learn 
the item’s properties). This focus can take the form of 
weapon practice, meditation, or some other appropriate 
activity. If the short rest is interrupted, the attunement 
attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the short rest, the 
creature gains an intuitive understanding of how to ac- 
tivate any magical properties of the item, including any 
necessary command words. 

An item can be attuned to only one creature at a time, 
and a creature can be attuned to no more than three 
magic items at a time. Any attempt to attune to a fourth 
item fails; the creature must end its attunement to an 
item first. Additionally, a creature can’t attune to more 
than one copy of an item. For example, a creature can’t 
attune to more than one ring of protection at a time. 

A creature’s attunement to an item ends if the creature 
no longer satisfies the prerequisites for attunement, if 
the item has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24 
hours, if the creature dies, or if another creature attunes 
to the item. A creature can also voluntarily end attune- 
ment by spending another short rest focused on the item, 
unless the item is cursed. 


ITEM DESCRIPTIONS 


AMULET OF HEALTH 
Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement) 


Your Constitution score is 19 while you wear this amulet. 
It has no effect on you if your Constitution is 19 or higher 
without it. 


ARMOR, +1, +2, OR +3 
Armor (light, medium, or heavy), rare (+1), very rare (+2), 
or legendary (+3) 


You have a bonus to AC while wearing this armor. The 
bonus is determined by its rarity. 


BAG OF HOLDING 
Wondrous item, uncommon 


This bag has an interior space considerably larger than 
its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at 

the mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to 500 
pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag 
weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving 
an item from the bag requires an action. 

If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures 
and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the 
Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents 
spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right be- 
fore it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the 
bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 
divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), 
after which time they begin to suffocate. 

Placing a bag of holding inside an extradimensional 
space created by a Heward’s handy haversack, portable 
hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and 
opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates 
where the one item was placed inside the other. Any 
creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it 
to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then 
closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be reopened. 


BOOTS OF STRIDING AND SPRINGING 
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) 


While you wear these boots, your walking speed be- 
comes 30 feet, unless your walking speed is higher, and 
your speed isn’t reduced if you are encumbered or wear- 
ing heavy armor. In addition, you can jump three times 
the normal distance, though you can’t jump farther than 
your remaining movement would allow. 


CLOAK OF ELVENKIND 
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) 


While you wear this cloak with its hood up, Wisdom (Per- 
ception) checks made to see you have disadvantage, and 
you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to 
hide, as the cloak’s color shifts to camouflage you. Pull- 
ing the hood up or down requires an action.

GAUNTLETS OF OGRE POWER 
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) 


Your Strength score is 19 while you wear these gaunt- 
lets. They have no effect on you if your Strength is 19 or 
higher without them. 


GLOVES OF SWIMMING AND CLIMBING 
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) 


While wearing these gloves, climbing and swimming 
don’t cost you extra movement, and you gain a +5 bonus 
to Strength (Athletics) checks made to climb or swim. 


GOGGLES OF NIGHT 
Wondrous item, uncommon 


While wearing these dark lenses, you have darkvision out 
to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, wear- 
ing the goggles increases its range by 60 feet. 


HEADBAND OF INTELLECT 
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) 


Your Intelligence score is 19 while you wear this head- 
band. It has no effect on you if your Intelligence is 19 or 
higher without it. 


KEOGHTOM’S OINTMENT 
Wondrous item, uncommon 


This glass jar, 3 inches in diameter, contains 1d4 + 1 
doses of a thick mixture that smells faintly of aloe. The 
jar and its contents weigh 1/2 pound. 

As an action, one dose of the ointment can be swal- 
lowed or applied to the skin. The creature that receives it 
regains 2d8 + 2 hit points, ceases to be poisoned, and is 
cured of any disease. 


POTION OF FLYING 
Potion, very rare 


When you drink this potion, you gain a flying speed equal 
to your walking speed for 1 hour and can hover. If you’re 
in the air when the potion wears off, you fall unless you 
have some other means of staying aloft. This potion’s 
clear liquid floats at the top of its container and has 
cloudy white impurities drifting in it. 


POTION OF INVISIBILITY 
Potion, very rare 


This potion’s container looks empty but feels as though it 
holds liquid. When you drink it, you become invisible for 
1 hour. Anything you wear or carry is invisible with you. 
The effect ends early if you attack or cast a spell. 


POTION OF VITALITY 
Potion, very rare 


When you drink this potion, it removes any exhaustion 
you are suffering and cures any disease or poison affect- 
ing you. For the next 24 hours, you regain the maximum 
number of hit points for any Hit Die you spend. The 
potion’s crimson liquid regularly pulses with dull light, 
calling to mind a heartbeat. 


RING OF EVASION 
Ring, rare (requires attunement) 


This ring has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended 
charges daily at dawn. When you fail a Dexterity sav- 
ing throw while wearing it, you can use your reaction 
to expend 1 of its charges to succeed on that saving 
throw instead. 


RING OF PROTECTION 
Ring, rare (requires attunement) 


You gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws while wear- 
ing this ring. 


RING OF RESISTANCE 
Ring, rare (requires attunement) 


You have resistance to one damage type while wearing 
this ring. The gem in the ring indicates the type, which 
the DM chooses or determines randomly.

SPELL SCROLL 
Scroll, varies 


A spell scroll bears the words of a single spell, written 

in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class’s spell 
list, you can read the scroll and cast its spell without pro- 
viding any material components. Otherwise, the scroll 

is unintelligible. Casting the spell by reading the scroll 
requires the spell’s normal casting time. Once the spell is 
cast, the words on the scroll fade, and it crumbles to dust. 
If the casting is interrupted, the scroll is not lost. 

If the spell is on your class’s spell list but of a higher 
level than you can normally cast, you must make an 
ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine 
whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + the 
spell’s level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from 
the scroll with no other effect. 

Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and 
the scroll itself crumbles to dust. 

The level of the spell on the scroll determines the 
spell’s saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the 
scroll’s rarity, as shown in the Spell Scroll table.

A wizard spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as 
spells in spellbooks can be copied. When a spell is copied 
from a spell scroll, the copier must succeed on an Intelli- 
gence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell’s 
level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully cop- 
ied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spel/ scroll 
is destroyed. 


‘WAND OF Macic DETECTION 
Wand, uncommon 


This wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can 
expend 1 charge as an action to cast the detect magic 
spell from it. The wand regains 1d3 expended charges 
daily at dawn. 


WAND OF MAGIC MISSILES 
Wand, uncommon 


While you hold this wand, you can use an action to ex- 
pend 1 to 3 of its 7 charges to cast the magic missile spell 
without using any components. For 1 charge, you cast the 
spell as if you used a 1st-level spell slot, and you increase 
the spell slot level by one for each additional charge 

you spend. 

The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges each day 
at dawn. However, if you expend the wand’s last charge, 
roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is 
destroyed.

EXHAUSTION 
Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as 
starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching 
temperatures, can lead to a special condition called 
exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect 
can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as 
specified in the effect’s description. 


Level Effect 
1 Disadvantage on ability checks 
2 Speed halved 
3 Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws 
4 Hit point maximum halved 
5 Speed reduced to 0 
6 Death 


If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that 
causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases 
by the amount specified in the effect’s description. 

A creature suffers the effect of its current level of 
exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a 
creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved 
and has disadvantage on ability checks. 

An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as 
specified in the effect’s description, with all exhaustion 
effects ending if a creature’s exhaustion level is 
reduced below 1. 

Finishing a long rest reduces a creature’s exhaustion level 
by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some 
food and drink. Also, being raised from the dead reduces a 
creature’s exhaustion level by 1.

APPENDIX B: GODS OF 
THE MULTIVERSE 


RELIGION IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF LIFE IN THE WORLDS OF 
the D&amp;D multiverse. When gods walk the world, clerics 
channel divine power, evil cults perform dark sacrifices 
in subterranean lairs, and shining paladins stand like 
beacons against the darkness, it’s hard to be ambivalent 
about the deities and deny their existence. 

Many people in the worlds of D&amp;D worship different 
gods at different times and circumstances. People in the 
Forgotten Realms, for example, might pray to Sune for 
luck in love, make an offering to Waukeen before heading 
to the market, and pray to appease Talos when a severe 
storm blows in—all in the same day. Many people have a 
favorite among the gods, one whose ideals and teachings 
they make their own. And a few people dedicate them- 
selves entirely to a single god, usually serving as a priest 
or champion of that god’s ideals. 

Your DM determines which gods, if any, are worshiped 
in his or her campaign. From among the gods available, 
you can choose a single deity for your character to serve, 
worship, or pay lip service to. Or you can pick a few that 
your character prays to most often. Or just make a mental 
note of the gods who are revered in your DM’s campaign 
so you can invoke their names when appropriate. If you're 
playing a cleric or a character with the Acolyte back- 
ground, decide which god your deity serves or served, and 
consider the deity’s suggested domains when selecting 
your character’s domain. 


D&amp;D PANTHEONS 


Each world in the D&amp;D multiverse has its own pantheons 
of deities. This appendix deals with one pantheon, that of 
the Forgotten Realms. 


THE FORGOTTEN REALMS 

Dozens of deities are revered, worshiped, and feared 
throughout the world of the Forgotten Realms. At least 
thirty deities are widely known across the Realms, and 
many more are worshiped locally, by individual tribes, 
small cults, or certain sects of larger religious temples. 


NONHUMAN DEITIES 
Certain gods closely associated with nonhuman races 
are revered on many different worlds, though not always 
in the same way. The nonhuman races of the Forgotten 
Realms and Greyhawk share these deities. 

Nonhuman races often have whole pantheons of 
their own. Besides Moradin, for example, the dwarf 
gods include Moradin’s wife, Berronar Truesilver, and 
a number of other gods thought to be their children 
and grandchildren: Abbathor, Clangeddin Silverbeard, 
Dugmaren Brightmantle, Dumathoin, Gorm Gulthyn, 
Haela Brightaxe, Marthammor Duin, Sharindlar, Thard 
Harr, and Vergadain. Individual clans and kingdoms of 
dwarves might revere some, all, or none of these deities, 
and some have other gods unknown (or known by other 
names) to outsiders.

APPENDIX C: THE FIVE FACTIONS 


MANY CHARACTERS CREATED IN THE FORGOTTEN REALMS 
setting, especially those for organized D&amp;D play, belong 
to one of five factions that have risen to prominence in the 
world of Faertin. Each faction has its own motivations, 
goals, and philosophy. Some are more heroic than others, 
but all band together in times of trouble to address ma- 
jor threats. 


HARPERS 


The clandestine network of 
spellcasters and spies known 
as the Harpers seeks to tip the 
scales in favor of the innocent, 
the weak, and the poor. Harper 
agents pride themselves on 
being incorruptible defenders 
of good, and they never hesitate 
to aid the oppressed. Because 
they prefer to work behind the 
scenes, they are rarely noticed 
as they thwart tyrants, depose 
rulers, and head off any growing 
force that is thought to have evil 
intent. The faction has its finger 
on the pulse of power in the 
Realms, and its members work tirelessly to even the odds 
for the downtrodden. 

Individual Harper agents operate alone, relying on their 
wits and the faction’s extensive information network to 
gain an advantage over their enemies. They know that 
knowledge is power, so gathering intelligence beforehand 
is paramount to their success. They are well informed 
and always have access to aid, magical and otherwise. 
Veteran members have secret caches of information 
stashed all over Faerfin, along with trusted sources sta- 
tioned in every major town and city. 

The organization is always on the lookout for pow- 
erful items, expressly to keep them out of the hands of 
evildoers. To this end, its agents use various guises and 
identities to aid their search for carefully guarded secrets 
such as ancestral maps, buried cities, and mages’ keeps. 

The bond between Harpers is strong, and the 
friendships they form are nigh unbreakable. Rarely do 
they operate in the open, but on rare occasions they must, 
because there is no other choice. When that happens, 
you can be sure that a fellow Harper is watching closely, 
ready to dart out from the shadows and help a comrade at 
a moment’s notice. 


WA” 


A Harper is first and foremost self-reliant, for once you are 
autonomous, no one can tempt you into using power as a 
crutch. You are sovereign unto yourself. 

Therefore, a Harper’s soul must be incorruptible. Many 
believe themselves to be so, but power comes in many guises, 
and it will surely find your weakness. Of this you may be 
certain. Only a true Harper can pass this test and transform 
weakness into strength. That is why we are the hand that 





stops the tyrant, feeds the oppressed, and asks for noth- 
ing in return. 
We are the song for those who have no voice. 
—Remallia “Remi” Haventree 


ORDER OF THE 
GAUNTLET 


The Order of the Gauntlet is a 
relatively new organization ded- 
icated to smiting evil wherever 
it lurks and without hesitation. 
Its members understands that 
evil wears many guises, playing 
games and tricking others in 
order to hasten its spread. That 
is why its members act on their 
own authority, identifying threats 
and removing them before they 
can reach their full potential. 

Because the seeds of evil are 
nourished in the shadows, the 
Order of the Gauntlet rides out to the most dangerous 
dungeons, the darkest caverns, and the foulest pits to 
weed out wrongdoers. Even so, its members are keenly 
aware that the seed of evil lies within everyone, waiting 
for a moment when it can take root in their souls. The or- 
der’s paladins, monks, and clerics spend long hours deep 
in prayer to keep their inner eye vigilant and focused on 
their own thoughts and emotions. In this way they purify 
themselves from within before taking up their swords to 
cleanse the world. 

The Order of the Gauntlet believes that all sentient 
beings must come forth into the light of reason and good- 
ness of their own volition. That is why the faction is not 
interested in controlling minds: it focuses only on deeds, 
setting an example for the world in the hope of inspiring 
and enlightening others. The order holds that faith in 
one’s god, one’s friends, and one’s self are the best weap- 
ons for combating the hordes of malice. 

Possessed of such devout conviction, the order’s 
members can be relied on as a source of strength 
to themselves and others, a bright light against the 
darkness. They are not preemptive bullies, though. A 
strict code of honor allows them to strike only when 
evil deeds are being committed. Thus, the Order of the 
Gauntlet is constantly vigilant, using every resource at its 
disposal—both magical and mundane—to tell where and 
when dark deeds will occur. 





That’s the thing about evil: it is darkness, it is shadow, it hides 
in your blind spot. Then, when you are distracted, it sneaks 
in. Evil is a master of disguise—and what is the greatest dis- 
guise, you ask? Yourself. Evil will cloak itself in thoughts and 
emotions pretending to be your own, telling you to get angry, 
to be greedy and envious, to hold yourself above others.

People aren't born evil—it takes time for evil to fool.you 
into thinking that its voice is yours. That is why to know who 
you truly are is what the order requires from each hopeful 
who wishes to join our ranks. Bravery isn’t fighting the drag- 
on out there—it is fighting the dragon within. That is what 
we do in our prayers. Once you have slain that dragon, you 
have overcome the darkness lurking within yourself. Only 
then do you have the capacity to know true goodness. Only 
then are you ready to take up the sword and wear the badge 
of our order. 

—Kajiso Steelhand 


EMERALD ENCLAVE 


The Emerald Enclave is a far-ranging group that opposes 


threats to the natural world and helps others survive 
in the wilderness. Branches of 
the organization are scattered 
throughout Faerdin and often 
operate in isolation from the 
others. This existence instills in 
the enclave’s members a fierce 
self-reliance and mastery of cer- 
tain fighting and survival skills. 

A ranger of the enclave might 
be hired to lead a caravan 
through a treacherous moun- 
tain pass or across the frozen 
tundra of Icewind Dale. A druid 
might volunteer to help a village 
prepare for a long, brutal winter. 
Barbarians and druids who live 
as hermits might appear from nowhere to help defend a 
town against marauding orcs. 

Members of the Emerald Enclave know how to survive 
and, more important, how to help others do the same. 
They are not opposed to civilization or progress, but 
they strive to keep such “advances” in balance with the 
wild. They restore and preserve the natural order, even 
as they root out and destroy all that is unnatural. They 
keep the elemental forces of the world in check and 
prevent civilization and the wilderness from destroying 
one another. 


WV” 


We of the Emerald Enclave serve as gatekeepers to that vast 
space beyond the city walls. We are the defenders both of the 
wilderness and of the society that does not understand it. 
Most have forgotten that there is an ancient, natural order 
that held sway long before we formed our intellectual con- 
cepts of it. To come into contact with that primal order is to 
touch the power that guides all of life. 

Those who walk the way of the Emerald Enclave are 
infused with this power; we embody it, and it moves us to 
do our work. That is why we are never alone. Even in the 





midst of a noisy, crowded city, we can feel the presence of the 
natural world inside us, fresh, strong, and alive. The enclave 
seeks to make awareness of this power available to all. 
Freedom. Is not this the highest of callings? 
—Delaan Winterhound 


Lorps’ ALLIANCE 


The Lords’ Alliance is an asso- 
ciation of rulers from cities and 
towns across Faerfin (primarily 
in the North), who believe that 
solidarity is needed to keep evil 
at bay. The rulers of Waterdeep, 
Silverymoon, Neverwinter, and 
other free cities dominate the 
coalition, and all lords in the alli- 
ance work primarily for the fate 
and fortune of their individual 
settlements. 

Alliance agents include sophis- 
ticated bards, zealous paladins, 
talented mages, and grizzled 
warriors. They are chosen pri- 
marily for their loyalty and are experts in observation, 
stealth, innuendo, and combat. Backed by the wealthy 
and the privileged, they carry fine equipment (often dis- 
guised to appear common), including large numbers of 
scrolls scribed with spells of communication. 

Agents of the Lords’ Alliance ensure the safety and 
prosperity of civilized Faerfin by standing united against 
the forces that threaten civilization. They aggressively 
eliminate such threats by any means, fighting with pride 
for the glory and security of their people, and for the 
welfare of the lords who rule over those folk. Alliance 
operatives are often motivated by glory, looking to gain 
an advantage in status over their counterparts from 
other alliance cities. The leaders of the faction know that 
the group will survive only if its members support each 
other, requiring all to find a balance between pride and 
diplomacy. Rogue agents within the Lords’ Alliance are 
rare, but defections have been known to occur.

Everyone wants to sleep at night and feel safe in their homes, 
but how many want to do what it takes to keep the tide of 
evil at bay? To stand in the cold and rain, waiting for battle 
while hunger gnaws at their bellies? Many wish to reap the 
rewards of a good harvest, but few care to remove the stones 
and till the fields for planting. 

The Lords’ Alliance fights the things that the shopkeeper in 
his bed has never even heard of. We remove threats before 
the town mayor even knows about them. We make bad 
things go away. That’s what we're good at.

ZHENTARIM 


The Zhentarim, also called the 
Black Network, is an organiza- 
tion of well-trained mercenaries, 
savvy rogues, and crafty war- 
locks who seek to expand their 
influence and power throughout 
Faerfin. Agents of the Zhen- 
tarim believe that if they play 

by the rules, nothing gets done. 
Ultimately, they want to make 
the rules—and, in some cases, 
they already have. They walk a 
careful line when it comes to fol- 
lowing the letter of the law and 
don’t shy away from the occa- 
sional shady deal or illicit activity 
to get what they want. 

To the Zhentarim, wealth is power. Its agents know 
that nothing else inspires such confidence and dispels 
doubt so well. Zhentarim agents routinely carry the finest 
weapons and armor, since the faction spares no expense 
in their outfitting. When a merchant needs an escort for a 
caravan, when a noble family requires bodyguards to pro- 
tect its holdings, or when a city is desperate for trained 
soldiers to defend its walls, the Zhentarim provides the 
best warriors money can buy. 


VF 





The organization encourages individual ambition and 
rewards innovators who take matters into their own 
hands. Results are all that matter. Those who come 
into the Black Network with nothing can become major 
players within the organization through their own 
ambition and perseverance. 

Membership in the Zhentarim is like a key to a thousand 
doors, each one a gateway to fulfilling a personal desire. 
Most people shy away from this kind of freedom. They like 
their restraints, laws, and swaddling—it gives them the illu- 
sion of security. 

The Black Network provides what I need to explore realms 
and dimensions that would tear apart minds accustomed to 
limits. Only in such places can I find magic powerful enough 
to defeat beings that know no such things as time, fear, or 
mercy. You might not like the Zhentarim’s methods, but when 
a demon crawls out of the Abyss and comes for your family, 
you'll be glad that I have gone to the darkest of realms to find 
the answer to your problem.

WHAT COMES NEXT? 


The Starter Set is a great next step if you want to try 
your hand at being a Dungeon Master and introduce your 
friends to the game. If you don’t know any DMs, try tak- 
ing on that role yourself. The Starter Set is the best place 
to begin your journey. 

The Player’s Handbook is your essential guide to 
additional races, classes, backgrounds, and other cus- 
tomization options such as feats and multiclassing. You'll 
also find more than two hundred extra spells and a beau- 
tiful array of art depicting elements of D&amp;D. 

The Monster Manual describes the most important 
monsters in the DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS universe. The 
manual is aimed at DMs, but it’s also a useful reference 
for players. 

The Dungeon Master’s Guide is the ultimate tome of 
DM lore. It includes magic items, optional rules, and 
guidelines for creating everything from a simple dungeon 
to an entire cosmos for your campaign. 

Each year brings the publication of new D&amp;D adven- 
tures. These scenarios and campaigns are the perfect 
way to try your hand at running a D&amp;D game with a mini- 
mum of work. 

Looking for a regular D&amp;D game or prefer dropping in 
when you have time? Check the Store and Event Locator 
on our website to see if your local game store is running 
events such as D&amp;D Encounters or D&amp;D Expeditions. 

Bring your games to life with a suite of enhancements 
from a robust set of player and DM digital tools to ac- 
cessories like miniatures, vinyl mats, campaign maps, 
clothing, and more. 





It isn’t always possible to gather a regular gaming 
group. In such situations, DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS 
board games present an ideal casual play experience. 
You'll also find a variety of digital games that offer a D&amp;D 
experience across Mac, PC, tablets, and mobile devices.
